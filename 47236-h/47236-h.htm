done to Euripides by Recent Critics.</p></div>


<p>The chapters on &AElig;schylus and Sophocles have already introduced
the reader to some of the principal questions regarding
Attic tragedy in general. Yet the opening of a new volume justifies
the resumption of this subject from the beginning, while
the peculiar position of Euripides, in relation to his two great
predecessors, suggests the systematic discussion of the religious
ideas which underlay this supreme form of national art, as well
as of the &aelig;sthetical rules which it obeyed in Greece.</p>

<p>Critics who are contented with referring the origin of the
Greek drama to the mimetic instinct inherent in all humanity
are apt to neglect those circumstances which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>render it an almost
unique phenomenon in literature. If the mimetic instinct were
all that is requisite for the origination of a national drama, then
we might expect to find that every race at a certain period of its
development produced both tragedy and comedy. This, however,
is far from being the case. A certain rude mimesis, such as
the acting of descriptive dances or the jesting of buffoons and
mummers, is indeed common in all ages and nations. But there
are only two races which can be said to have produced the drama
as a fine art originally and independently of foreign influences.
These are the Greeks and the Hindoos. With reference to the
latter, it is even questionable whether they would have composed
plays so perfect as their famous <i>Sakountala</i> without contact with
Hellenic civilization. All the products of the modern drama,
whether tragic or comic, must be regarded as the direct progeny
of the Greek stage. The habit of play-acting, continued from
Athens to Alexandria, and from Rome to Byzantium, never wholly
expired. The "Christus Patiens," attributed to Gregory of
Nazianzus, was an adaptation of the art of Euripides to Christian
story; and the representation of "Mysteries" during the Middle
Ages kept alive the dramatic tradition, until the discovery of classic
literature and the revival of taste in modern Europe led to the
great works of the English, Spanish, French, and subsequently of
the German theatre.</p>

<p>Something more than the mere instinct of imitation, therefore,
caused the Greeks to develop their drama. Like sculpture, like
the epic, the drama was one of the artistic forms through which
the genius of the Greek race expressed itself&mdash;by which, to use
the language of philosophical mysticism, it fulfilled its destiny as
a prime agent in the manifestation of the World-Spirit. In their
realization of that perfect work of art for which t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>hey seem to
have been specially ordained, the drama was no less requisite than
sculpture and architecture, than the epic, the ode, and the idyl.</p>

<p>Two conditions, both of which the Greeks enjoyed in full perfection
at the moment of their first dramatic energy, seem to be
requisite for the production of a great and thoroughly national
drama. These are, first, an era of intense activity or a period
succeeding immediately to one of excitement, by which the nation
has been nobly agitated; secondly, a public worthy of the
dramatist spurring him on by its enthusiasm and intelligence to
the creation of high works of art. A glance at the history of
the drama in modern times will prove how necessary these conditions
are. It was the gigantic effort which we English people
made in our struggle with Rome and Spain, it was the rousing of
our keenest thought and profoundest emotion by the Reformation,
which prepared us for the Elizabethan drama, by far the
greatest, next to the Greek, in literature. The nation lived in action,
and delighted to see great actions imitated. Races in repose
or servitude, like the Hebrews under the Roman empire, may, in
their state of spiritual exaltation and by effort of pondering on
the mysteries of God and man, give birth to new theosophies; but
it requires a free and active race, in which young and turbulent
blood is flowing, to produce a drama. In England, again, at that
time, there was a great public. All classes crowded to the theatres.
London, in whose streets and squares martyrs had been
burned, on whose quays the pioneers of the Atlantic and Pacific,
after disputing the Indies with Spain, lounged and enjoyed their
leisure, supplied an eager audience, delighting in the dreams of
poets which recalled to mind the realities of their own lives, appreciating
the passion of tragedy, enjoying the mirth of comic incident.
The men who listened to <i>Othe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>llo</i> had both done and suffered
largely; their own experience was mirrored in the scenes of
blood and struggle set before them. These two things, therefore&mdash;the
awakening of the whole English nation to activity, and the
presence of a free and haughty audience&mdash;made our drama great.</p>

<p>In the Spanish drama only one of the requisite conditions was
fulfilled&mdash;activity. Before they began to write plays the Spaniards
had expelled the Moors, discovered the New World, and
raised themselves to the first place among European nations.
But there was not the same free audience in Spain as in England.
Papal despotism and the tyranny of the court checked
and coerced the drama, so that, with all its richness and imaginative
splendor, the Spanish theatre is inferior to the English. The
French drama suffered still more from the same kind of restriction.
Subject to the canons of scholastic pedants, tied down to
an imitation of the antique, made to reflect the manners and sentiments
of a highly artificial court, animated by the sympathies
of no large national audience, the French playwrights became
courtiers, artists obedient to the pleasures of a king&mdash;not, like
the dramatists of Greece and England, the prophets of the people,
the leaders of a chorus triumphant and rejoicing in its mighty
deeds.</p>

<p>Italy has no real theatre. In Italy there has been no stirring
of a national, united spirit; no supreme and central audience; no
sudden consciousness of innate force and freedom in the sovereign
people. The requisite conditions have always failed. The
German drama, both by its successes and shortcomings, illustrates
the same position. Such greatness as it achieved in Goethe and
Schiller it owed to the fermentation of German nationality, to
the so-called period of "storm and stress" which electrified the
intellects of Germany and made the Germans eager to assert <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>their
manhood among nations. But listen to Goethe complaining that
there was no public to receive his works; study the petty cabals
of Weimar; estimate the imitative and laborious spirit of German
art, and it is clear why Germany produced but scattered
and imperfect results in the drama.</p>

<p>The examples of England, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, all
tend to prove that for the creation of a drama it is necessary
that the condition of national activity should be combined with
the condition of a national audience&mdash;not an audience of courtiers
or critics or learned persons. In Greece, both of these
conditions were united in unrivalled and absolute perfection.
While in England, during the Elizabethan period, the public
which crowded our theatres were uncultivated, and formed but
a small portion of the free nation they represented, in Athens
the people, collectively and in a body, witnessed the dramatic
shows provided for them in the theatre of Bacchus. The same
set of men, when assembled in the Pnyx, constituted the national
assembly; and in that capacity made laws, voted supplies, declared
wars, ratified alliances, ruled the affairs of dependent cities.
In a word, they were Athens. Every man among them&mdash;by intercourse
with the greatest spirits of the Greek world in the agora
and porches of the wrestling-grounds, by contemplation of the
sculptures of Pheidias, by familiarity with Eleusinian processions,
by participation in solemn sacrifices and choric dances, by listening
to the recitations of Homer, by attendance on the lectures of
the sophists, by debates in the ecclesia, by pleadings in the law-courts&mdash;had
been multifariously educated and rendered capable
of appreciating the subtleties of rhetoric and argument, as well as
of comprehending t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>he &aelig;sthetical beauty with which a Greek play
was enriched. It is easy to imagine the influence which this potent,
multitudinous, and highly cultivated audience must have exercised
over the dramatists, and what an impulse it must have
communicated to their genius. In England the playwright and
the actor were both looked down upon with pity or contempt;
they wrote and acted for money in private speculations, and in
rivalry with several petty theatres. In Athens the tragedian was
honored. Sophocles was elected a general with Pericles, and a
member of the provisional government after the dissolution of
the old democracy. The actor, too, was respected. The State
itself defrayed the expenses of the drama, and no ignoble competition
was possible between tragedian and tragedian, since all exhibited
their plays to the same audience, in the same sacred theatre,
and all were judged by the same judges.</p>

<p>The critical condition of the Greek people itself at the epoch
of the drama is worth minute consideration. During the two
previous centuries, the whole of Hellas had received a long and
careful education: at the conclusion came the terrible convulsion
of the Persian war. After the decay of the old monarchies, the
Greek states seethed for years in the process of dissolution and reconstruction.
The colonies had been founded. The aristocratic
families had striven with the mob in every city; and from one
or the other power at times tyrants had risen to control both
parties and oppress the commonwealth. Out of these political
disturbances there gradually arose a sense of law, a desire for established
constitutions. There emerged at last the prospect of
political and social stability. Meanwhile, in all departments of
art and literature, the Greeks had been developing their genius.
Lyrical, satirical, and elegiac poetry had been carried to perfection.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> Gnomic poets and the Seven Sages had crystallized
morality in apothegms. Philosophy had taken root in the colonies.
Sculpture had almost reached its highest point. The
Greek games, practised through nearly three hundred years, had
created a sense of national unity. It seemed as if all the acquirements
and achievements of the race had been spread abroad to
form a solid and substantial base for some most comprehensive
superstructure. Then, while Hellas was at this point of magnificent
but still incomplete development, there followed, first, the expulsion
of the Peisistratids from Athens, which aroused the spirit
of that mighty nation, and then the invasion of Xerxes, which
electrified the whole Greek world. It was this that inflamed the
genius of Greece; this transformed the race of thinkers, poets, artists,
statesmen, into a race of heroes, actors in the noblest sense of
the word. The struggle with Persia, too, gave to Athens her right
place. Assuming the hegemony of Hellas, to which she was fore-destined
by her spiritual superiority, she flashed in the supreme
moment which followed the battle of Salamis into the full consciousness
of her own greatness. It was now, when the Persian
war had made the Greeks a nation of soldiers, and had placed the
crown on Athens, that the drama&mdash;that form of art which combines
all kinds of poetry in one, which subordinates sculpture,
painting, architecture, music, dancing, to its own use, and renders
all arts subservient to the one end of action&mdash;appeared in its colossal
majesty upon the Attic stage.</p>

<p>At this point of history the drama was a necessary product.
The forces which had given birth to all the other forms of art
were still exuberant and unexhausted, needing their completion.
At the same time, nothing but the impassioned presentation of
humanity in action could possibly have satisfied the men who
had themselves enacted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the plains and straits of Attica the
greatest and most artistic drama of real history. It was one of
the chief actors of Marathon and Salamis who composed the <i>Prometheus</i>,
and personated his own hero on the stage.</p>

<p>If we proceed to analyze the cardinal idea of Greek tragedy,
we shall again observe the close connection which exists between
the drama and the circumstances of the people at the time of its
production. Schlegel, in his <i>Lectures on the Drama</i>, defines the
prevailing idea of Greek tragedy to be the sense of an oppressive
destiny&mdash;a fate against which the will of man blindly and vainly
dashes. This conception of hereditary destiny seems to be strongly
illustrated by many plays. Orestes, &#338;dipus, Antigone, are unable
to escape their doom. Beautiful human heroism and exquisite
innocence are alike sacrificed to the fatality attending an
accursed house. Yet Schlegel has not gone far enough in his
analysis. He has not seen that this inflexible fate is set in motion
by a superior and anterior power, that it operates in the service
of offended justice. When &#338;dipus slays his father, he does
so in contempt of oracular warnings. Orestes, haunted by the
Furies, has a mother's blood upon his hands, and unexpiated
crimes of father and of grandsire to atone for. Antigone, the
best of daughters and most loving of sisters, dies miserably, not
dogged by Fate, but having of her own free will exposed her life
in obedience to the pure laws of the heart. It is impossible to
suppose that a Greek would have been satisfied with the bald
fate-theory of Schlegel. Not fate, but Nemesis, was the ruling
notion in Greek tragedy. A profound sense of the divine government
of the world, of a righteous power punishing pride and
vice, pursuing the c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>hildren of the guilty to the tenth generation,
but showing mercy to the contrite&mdash;in short, a mysterious and almost
Jewish ideal of offended holiness pervades the whole work
of the tragedians. This religious conception had gradually defined
itself in the consciousness of the Greek race. Homer in both
his epics presents us with the spectacle of crime punished. It is
the sin of Paris and the obstinacy of the Trojan princes which
lead to the fall of Troy. It is the insolence of the suitors in the
<i>Odyssey</i> which brings them to their death. The Cyclical poets
seem to have dwelt on the same theme. The storm which fell
on the Achaian fleet, dispersing or drowning the heroes, was
a punishment for their impiety and pride during the sack of
Troy. The madness of Ajax followed his violence upon Cassandra.
When conscious morality begins in Greece the idea is at
once made prominent. Hesiod continually insists on justice,
whose law no man may violate unpunished. The Gnomic poets
show how guilt, if unavenged at the moment, brings calamity
upon the offspring of the evil-doer. This notion of an inheritance
of crime is particularly noticeable, since it tinged the whole
tragedy of the Greeks. Solon, again, in his dialogue with Cr&#339;sus,
develops another aspect of the same idea. With him the
Deity is jealous of all towering greatness, of all insolent prosperity;
his Nemesis punishes the pride of wealth and the lust of life.
Some of the most prominent personages of Greek tragedy&mdash;Creon,
&#338;dipus, Theseus, Agamemnon&mdash;illustrate this phase of the
idea. In the sayings of the Seven Sages we trace another shade
of the conception. All of them insist on moderation, modesty,
the right proportion, the due mean. The lyrists take up a somewhat
different position. The vicissitudes of life, both independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of and connected with personal guilt, fascinate their imagination.
They have a deep and awful sense of sudden catastrophes.
Pindar rises to a loftier level: his odes are pervaded by
reverence for a holy power, before whom the insolent are forced
to bow, by whom the humble are protected and the good rewarded.</p>

<p>Such are the traces of a doctrine of Nemesis to be found in all
the literature of the pre-dramatic period. That very event which
determined the sudden splendor of the drama gave a sublime and
terrific sanction to the already existing morality. The Persian
war exhibited the downfall of a haughty and insolent race, cut
off in all its pomp and power. Before the eyes of the men who
witnessed the calamities of &#338;dipus and Agamemnon on the stage,
the glory of godless Asia had vanished like a dream. Thus the
idea of Nemesis quelling the insolent and smiting the unholy was
realized in actual history; and to add to the impression produced
on Greek imagination by the destruction of the Persian hosts,
Pheidias carved his statue of Nemesis to be a monument in enduring
marble of the national morality. &AElig;schylus erected an even
more majestic monument to the same principle in his tragedies.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Nemesis is the fundamental idea of the Greek drama. It appears
strongest in &AElig;schylus, as a prophetic and awful law, mysteriously
felt and terribly revealed. Sophocles uses it to point
the deep moralities which govern human life. In Euripides it
degenerates into something more akin to a sense of vicissitudes;
it becomes more sentimental&mdash;less a religious or moral principle
than a phenomenon inspiring fear and pity. This sequence appears
to be necessary in the growth and expansion of a primitive
idea. Rugged and superstitious at first, it is next harmonized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>and humanized, and ends at last in being merely artistic.</p>

<p>In &AElig;schylus the fundamental moral law of Nemesis, as a part
of the divine government of the world, is set forth in three distinct
manifestations. We find it expressed mythologically, as abstract
and ideal, in the <i>Prometheus</i>. The offence of Prometheus
against Zeus, though unselfish and generous, must be expiated by
suffering; the rebellious demi-god must be brought at last to
merge his will in that of Zeus, to bind his brows with the willow
of submission, and to place upon his finger the iron ring of necessity.
We find it expressed typically, as still ideal and almost
superhuman, in the <i>Oresteia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></i>. Here a whole family is vitiated by
the offence of their first ancestor. The hereditary curse is renewed
and fortified from generation to generation, by the sins of
the children, until at last a reconciliation is effected between the
purifying deities and the infernal powers of vengeance. In the
<i>Pers&aelig;</i> the same law is exhibited as a fact of contemporary history.
It is no longer a matter of mythology, as in the <i>Prometheus</i>,
or a matter of heroic legend, as in the <i>Oresteia</i>, but a matter
of actual experience, that the godless man should suffer and
involve the innocent in his disaster. Thus the law of Nemesis is
displayed as an eternal verity in the <i>Prometheus</i>; and in the
<i>Oresteia</i> it is actualized and humanized within the region of heroic
legend; in the <i>Pers&aelig;</i> it is used for the explanation of every-day
events. The pedigree of inherited crime and vengeance, as
explained in the choruses of the <i>Oresteia</i>, and as illustrated by the
whole history of the Tantalid&aelig;, is this.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The pride of wealth in
the first instance swells the heart, and inclines its possessor to ungodly
thoughts. This leads to impiety (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#946;&#8051;&#962;), and in the
energetic language of the <i>Agamemnon</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the arrogant man kicks
with his heel against the altar of Justice. A state of presumptuous
insolence (&#8021;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#962;) is the result of the original unholiness. And
now the man, who has been corrupted in his soul, is ready for the
commission of some signal crime. Ate, or a blindness of the reason,
which prevents him from foreseeing the consequences of his
acts, is the child of this presumption. Inspired by Ate, he sheds
the blood of his brother, or defiles his sister's bed; and from
this moment the seed is sown which will spring up and breed
fresh mischief for each successive generation. After the spilling
of blood the affair passes into the hands of the Erinnyes, whose
business it is to beset the house of the guilty doer. They form
the bloody revel, which, though glutted with gore, refuse <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>to quit
the palace of Atreus. They leap upon it from above, and rack
it like a tempest. Yet from their power there is escape. The
curse of the house works; but it works only through the impure.
Should a man arise capable of seeing rightly and living purely, he
may work off the curse and become free. Such a man was Orestes.
The leading thought in this system of morality is that pride
begets impiety, impiety produces an insolent habit of mind, which
culminates in blindness; the fruit of this blindness is crime,
breeding crime from sire to son. It is only when the righteous
man appears, who performs an act of retributive justice, in obedience
to divine mandates, and without the indulgence of any
selfish passion, that the curse is stayed.</p>

<p>Such is a crude sketch of the &AElig;schylean theory of Nemesis,
as set forth in the great trilogy. To &AElig;schylus, the presentation
of the moral law conceived by him is of even more importance
than the exhibition of the characters of men controlled by
it. This is not the case with Sophocles. He fixes our attention
upon the &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;, or error of the guilty man, interests us in the
qualities by which he was betrayed into sin, and makes us feel
that suffering is the inevitable consequence of arrogant or wilful
acts. The weakness of the offender is more prominent in Sophocles
than the vengeance of the outraged deity. Thus, although
there is the sternest religious background to all the tragedies
of Sophocles, our attention is always fixed upon the humanity
of his heroes. The house of Labdacus is involved in hereditary
guilt. Laius, despising an oracle, begets a son by Jocasta, and
is slain by that son. &#338;dipus, in his youthful recklessness, careless
of oracular warnings, kills his father and weds his mother.
Jocasta, through her levity and impiety, is hurried into ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>rriage
with the murderer of her husband, who is also her own son. All
this &#945;&#8016;&#952;&#945;&#948;&#8055;&#945;, or headstrong wilfulness, is punished by the descent
of a fearful plague on Thebes; and &#338;dipus, whose heat of temper
and self-reliance are his only serious crime, is overpowered by
the abyss of misery into which these faults have plunged his people
and his family. The utter prostration of &#338;dipus&mdash;when his
eyes have been opened to the tissue of horrors he has woven
round himself, his mother, his nation, and his children&mdash;is the
first step in his moral discipline. He abdicates in favor of the insolent
Creon, and goes forth to wander, an abhorred and helpless
blind man, on the face of the earth. When, at the conclusion of
his pariah life, the citizens of Colonus refuse him harborage, he
only cries: "My deeds were rather sufferings than crimes." His
old heroic haughtiness and headstrong will are tempered to a noble
abhorrence of all baseness, to a fiery indignation. He has
been purged and lessoned to humility before the throne of Zeus.
Therefore, in return for his self-annihilation, the gods at last receive
him to their company, and constitute him a blessed d&aelig;mon
in the place of his disgrace. It was the highest triumph of tragic
art to exhibit that new phase in the character of &#338;dipus which
marks the conclusion of the <i>Tyrannus</i> and is sustained in the
<i>Colon&euml;us</i>. In both of these plays, &#338;dipus is the same man; but
circumstances have so wrought upon his temper as to produce a
great change. Still, the change is only commensurate with the
force of the circumstances. We comprehend it, while at the same
time we are forced to marvel at the profound skill of the poet,
who, in the first tragedy, has presented to our eyes the hot-tempered
king reduced to abject humiliation, and in the second has
shown us the same man dignified, and purified by the dealings of
the heavy hand of God. Set aside by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>his calamity, and severed
from the common lot of men, &#338;dipus has submitted to the divine
will and has communed with unseen powers. He is therefore
now environed with a treble mystery&mdash;with the mystery of his
awful past, the mystery of his god-conducted present, the mystery
of his august future. It was by such masterly delineation
of character that Sophocles threw the old &AElig;schylean dogma of
Nemesis into the background, and moralized his tragedy without
sacrificing an iota of its religious force. Aristotle, speaking of
the highest tragic art, says that its object is to represent an &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;,
a permanent habit of moral temper. Careless or bad art allows
impossible incongruities in the delineation of character, whereas
the true poet maintains identity throughout. If this be so, Sophocles
deserves the title of &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; in the very highest sense.
As a further illustration of the divergence of Sophocles from the
&AElig;schylean dogma of Nemesis, it is worth while to mention the
<i>Antigone</i>. This play takes us beyond the region of hereditary
guilt into the sphere of moral casuistry; its tragic interest depends
not upon the evolution of an ancestral curse, although Antigone
is incidentally involved in the crime of her brothers, but
upon the conflict of duties in a single heart. Antigone, while
obeying the law of her conscience, is disobeying the command of
her sovereign. She acted rightly; yet her offence was sufficient
to cause her legal death, and this death she chose with open eyes.
It is in the person of Creon that the old moral of Nemesis is
drawn. Like &#338;dipus, he treats the warnings of Teiresias with
scorn, and persists in his criminal persecution of the dead Polyneices.
Shaken at last by the seer's vaticinations, he rescinds his
orders, but too late. Antigone has hanged herself in prison; H&aelig;mon
curses his father, and stabs himself upon her corpse; Eurydice,
maddened with grief, puts an end to her own life; and thus
the house of the tyrant is left unto him desolate. It is quite impossible
by any phrases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> mere criticism to express the admiration
which every student of Sophocles must feel for the profundity
of his design, for the unity of his art, and for the firmness
with which he has combined the essential religious doctrines of
Greek tragedy with his own ethical philosophy.</p>

<p>In passing to Euripides we feel how much we have lost. The
religious foundation has been broken up; the clear intuitive morality
of Sophocles has been exchanged for sophistry, debate, hypothesis,
and paradox. In the delineation of character he wavers;
not because he could not create well-sustained types, since Medea,
Hippolytus, and many other Euripidean personages display sublime
and massive unity; but because, apparently owing to the
rapid development of the dramatic art and the speculative ferment
of the age in which he lived, he was more interested in the
creation of plots and situations, in the discussion of vexed questions,
and in the critical rehandling of apparently exhausted motives,
than in the exhibition of the truly tragic &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;. The praise
bestowed on him by Aristotle as being &#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, proves that
his contemporaries had recognized this source of both his weakness
and his strength.</p>

<p>While considering the work done by the three great tragic authors,
we must not forget that the Greek dramatists adhered to a
fixed body of legends; the tales of the House of Atreus, of Troy,
of the family of Laius at Thebes, of Herakles, of Jason, and of
Theseus, formed the staple of the plays of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides. This fact helps to account for the early decline
of the Greek drama. It was impossible for the successors of
&AElig;schylus and Sophocles to surpass them in the heroic treatment
of the same mythical motives. Yet custom and tra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>dition, the religious
antecedents of tragedy, the cumbrous apparatus of mask
and buskin and Bacchic robe, the conventional chorus, the very
size of the theatre, the whole form, in fact, of Greek dramatic art,
rendered a transition from the heroic to the romantic tragedy impossible.
Those fixed legends which &AElig;schylus had used as the
framework for his religious philosophy of Nemesis and Ate, from
which Sophocles had drawn deep lessons of morality, had to be
employed by Euripides as best he might. On their firmly traced,
inflexible outlines he embroidered his own work of pathos and
imagination, losing sight of the divine element, blurring morality,
but producing a world of fanciful yet living shapes of sentiment
and thought and passion.</p>

<p>If we seek to comprehend the position of Euripides in relation
to his predecessors, we must consider the changes which had taken
place in Athens between the period of the Persian war and that
in which he flourished. All the mutations of Greek history were
accomplished with celerity; but in this space of less than half a
century the rate of progress was nothing less than marvellous,
and the evolution of the Attic drama through its three great tragedians
was accomplished with a rapidity which is quite miraculous.
&AElig;schylus gained his first prize in 484 B.C., Sophocles his
first in 468 B.C., Euripides his first in 441 B.C. The <i>Medea</i> of
Euripides, a play which exhibits all the innovations of its author,
appeared in 431 B.C. Therefore a period of fifty-three years sufficed
for the complete development of the greatest work of art
the world has ever witnessed. The history of our own stage
offers a parallel to this extraordinary rapidity of growth. Marlowe
produced his <i>Tamburlaine</i> in 15<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>90, Ford his <i>Lover's Melancholy</i>
in 1628: between these two dates&mdash;that is to say, within
the compass of thirty-eight years&mdash;were composed all the plays
of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger,
Webster, Heywood, Decker, Marston, Chapman, Middleton,
and others whom it would be tedious to mention. Halliwell's
<i>Dictionary of Old English Plays</i> contains two hundred and eighty
closely printed pages; yet very few of the pieces he enumerates
are subsequent to what we call Elizabethan. But, though our
drama, in respect of fertility, offers a parallel to that of Athens,
we can show no three poets of paramount genius corresponding
to &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, each of whom would have
been sufficient by himself to mark a century in the growth of the
genius of his nation. Between &AElig;schylus and Sophocles there is
a wide chasm in religion, politics, and art; between Sophocles
and Euripides, again, there is a chasm in religion, politics, art, and
philosophy. Yet Sophocles, after superseding &AElig;schylus, lived to
put on mourning for the death of Euripides. Some of the men
of Marathon yet remained when Aristophanes was writing, both
to point his moral against Euripides, and also to prove by contrast
with the generation that had grown up since how impossible
it was for the poet of the present to vie with the &AElig;schylus
of the past. In the first place, Athens had become the centre of
progressive thought. Teachers of rhetoric and reasoning made
her wrestling-grounds and gardens the scene of their disputes and
lectures. The arts of eloquence were studied by the youth who
in a previous age had been contented with Homer. At Athens,
Anaxagoras had questioned the divinity of Helios, and had asserted
reason to be the moving force of the universe. Sophists
who taught the arts of life for money, and philosophers who subjected
morals to ingenious analysis, and explained away on scie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ntific
principles the ancient myths of Greek nature-worship, combined
to disturb ethical and religious traditions. A more solid,
because more reasoned, morality was springing up perhaps. A
purer monotheism was being inculcated. But meanwhile the old
Hellenic customs and the fabric of mythic theology were undermined.
It could not be but that the poet of the day should participate
in these changes. In the second place, the Athenian populace
had grown to be supreme in two departments&mdash;the high
parliament of State and the law-courts. Every Athenian was now
far more than formerly an orator or judge of orators, an advocate
or judge of advocates. Two passions possessed the popular mind:
the passion for the assembly with its stormy debate and pompous
declamation; the passion for the dikastery with its personal
interests, its problems of casuistical law, its momentous tragedies
of private life, its studied eloquence. Talking and listening were
the double function of an Athenian citizen. To speak well on
every subject, so as to gain causes in the courts, and to persuade
the people in the Pnyx; to criticise speeches with acumen, so as
not to be deluded by specious arguments: these were the prime
accomplishments of an Athenian youth of promise. It is obvious
that a very peculiar audience was thus formed for the tragedian&mdash;an
audience greedy of intellectual subtleties, of pathetic situations,
of splendid oratory, of clever reasoning&mdash;an audience more
appreciative of the striking than the true, of the novel than the
natural. In the third place, the Athenians had waxed delicate
and wanton since the Persian war. When &AElig;schylus began to
write, the peril of utter ruin hung like a stone of Tantalus over
Hellas. That removed, the Greeks breathed freely. The Athenians,
growing in wealth and power, neglected the old moderation
of their ancest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ors. Youths who in earlier days would have
fared hardly now drove their chariots, backed their fighting-cocks,
and followed their own sweet will. Aristotle quaintly enough observes
that the flute had become fashionable after the expulsion
of the Persians. The poet of the day could no longer be austere
like &AElig;schylus or sedate like Sophocles.</p>

<p>In all these changes Euripides partook. The pupil in rhetoric
of Prodicus, in philosophy of Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, a book-collector,
a student of painting, the friend of Socrates, cultivated
in all innovations of morality and creed, Euripides belonged essentially
to his own day. As far as a tragic dramatist can be
the mouthpiece of his age, Euripides was the mouthpiece of
Athenian decline. For this reason, because he so exactly expressed
the feelings and opinions of his time, which feelings and
opinions produced a permanent national habit of mind, Euripides
became the darling of posterity. &AElig;schylus was the Titanic product
of a bygone period; Sophocles displayed the pure and perfect
ideal; but Euripides was the artist who, without improving
on the spirit of his age, gave it a true and adequate expression.
The only wonder is that during his lifetime Euripides was not
more popular at Athens. His comparative neglect proves him to
have been somewhat in advance of his century, and justifies Aristophanes
in the reproach that he anticipated the Athenians in
the break-up of their forms of thought.</p>

<p>At this point we may consider the condition of the tragic art
when Euripides took it up as the business of his life. Though
tragedy, as formed by &AElig;schylus, represented one true and important
aspect of Greek thought&mdash;the religious&mdash;yet it could
never have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>dequate to the life of the whole nation in the
same degree as the many-sided drama of Shakespeare, for example,
was to that of our Elizabethan ancestors. Its regularity
and solemnity tended to make it an ideal work of art. It might
arouse the religious feeling, the national pride, the enthusiasm for
a legendary past, which were so powerful among the Athenians
of the Marathonian epoch. But it could not have had much attraction
for the Athenians of the Syracusan expedition. As men
subject to the divine rule, indeed, it had a message fraught with
meaning for them; but as Athenians of to-day it did not touch
them. We can well believe that this lofty, ceremonious art fatigued
a large portion of the Attic audience. After having listened
to some seventy plays of &AElig;schylus and fifty of Sophocles,
not to mention Phrynichus and Ch&#339;rilus, and scores of minor
dramatists, all teaching the same religious morality, and all obeying
the same &aelig;sthetic principles, we can conceive that a merry
Greek began to long for novelty. It must have required the supreme
genius of a Sophocles to sustain the attention of the audience
at its ancient altitude. In the hands of inferior poets, the
tragic commonplaces must have appeared insipid. Some change
seemed absolutely necessary. Euripides, a poet of very distinguished
originality, saw that he must adapt his dramatic style to
the new requirements of his audience, and give them what they
liked, even though it were not good for them. The sophistic
arguments, the strained situations, the law-court pleadings, the
pathetic touches, the meretricious lyrics, the philosophical explanations,
the sententious epigrams, the theatrical effects, which
mar his tragedies, were deliberate innovations on the old pure
style. Euripides had determined to bring tragedy home to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
hearts and understandings of the spectators. All the peculiarities
of his art flow from this one aim. This is the secret of what
may be described as his romantic realism, his twofold appeal to
sympathy by the invention of startling incident and by the faithful
delineation of vulgar life and common character. Whether
he did not pursue this aim on a false method, whether he might
not have aroused the sympathies of his audience without debasing
tragedy, remains a fit matter for debate.</p>

<p>Entirely to eliminate the idea of Nemesis, which gave its character
to Greek tragedy, was what Euripides, had he been so inclined,
could hardly have succeeded in effecting. Though he
never impresses on our minds the dogma of an avenging deity,
like &AElig;schylus, or of an inevitable law, like Sophocles, he makes
us feel the chance and change of human life, the helplessness of
man, the stormy sea of passions, sorrows, and vicissitudes on
which the soul is tossed. Conventional phrases about moderation
in all things, retributive justice, and the like, are used to
keep up the old tragic form. In this way he brought tragedy
down to the level of real life, wherein we do not trace the visible
finger of Providence, but where all seems at least confusion to
the natural eye. Euripides no more than Shakespeare sought
to be a prophet or interpreter of the divine operations. In the
same spirit he treated his materials with freedom. Adhering
conventionally, and as a form of art, to the mythical legends of
Hellas&mdash;that charmed circle beyond which the t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ragic muse had
never strayed&mdash;he adapted them to his own purposes. He gave
new characters to the principal heroes,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> mixed up legendary incidents
with trivial domestic scenes, lowered the language of
demigods to current Greek talk, hazarded occasional scepticism,
and introduced familiar phrases into ceremonious debates. The
sacred character of the myths disappeared; Euripides used them
as so many masses of entertaining folklore and fiction, fit for
tragic handling. In some instances, as, for example, in the <i>Ion</i>
and the ending of the <i>Hippolytus</i>, he may even have intended
an attack upon the ethics they had sanctioned. When we hear
Achilles and Orestes talking like Athenian citizens, wrangling,
perorating, subtilizing, seeking victory in strife of words, trifling
with questions of profoundest import, and settling moral problems
by verbal quibbles, we understand the remark of Sophocles
that he had painted men as they ought to be, Euripides as they
are. Medea and Alcestis are not the mythical Medea or the legendary
queen of Pher&aelig;, but an injured wife, and a devoted wife,
just such as Shakespeare or Balzac might have depicted. Menelaus
is invariably a faint-hearted, smooth-spoken, treasonable,
uxorious, vain man. Only in the <i>Helena</i>, when fairly driven to
bay, does he show the pluck of a soldier. Nothing can be more
contemptible than the Agamemnon of <i>Iphigenia in Aulide</i>. He
is a feeble, double-minded dastard, who has aspired to the commandership
in chief from motives of vulgar ambition, and who
finds himself unable to hold his own against cabal and mutiny.
This is perhaps a development of the Homeric conception, but
with all the Homeric radiance, the dignity that shields a monarch
from disgrace, omitted. But unfortunately for this attempt to
make Greek tragedy more real and living, more representative
of the actual world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> the cothurnus, the mask, the chorus, the
thymel&eacute;, the gigantic stage, remained. All the cumbrous paraphernalia
of the &AElig;schylean theatre environed the men and women
of Euripides, who cut but a poor figure in the garb of demigods.
In trying to adapt the mould of Greek tragedy to real
life, Euripides overpassed the limits of possibility. The mould
broke in his hands.</p>

<p>The same inevitable divergence from the &AElig;schylean system
is observable in every department of the tragedy of Euripides.
While Sophocles had diminished the direct interposition of mysterious
agencies, so frequently invoked by &AElig;schylus, and had
interested his audience in human character controlled and tempered
by an unseen will of God, Euripides went further. With
him the affairs of life are no longer based upon a firm foundation
of divine law, but gods intervene mechanically and freakishly,
like the magicians in Ariosto or Tasso.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Their agency is valuable,
not as determining the moral conduct of the personages,
but as an exhibition of supernatural power which brings about
a sudden revolution of events. Independently of their miraculous
activity, the human agents display all varieties of character:
every shade of virtue and vice is delicately portrayed; pathetic
scenes are multiplied; the tendernesses of domestic life
are brought prominently forward; mixed motives and conflicting
passions are skilfully analyzed. Consequently the plays of Euripides
are more rich in stirring incidents than those of his predecessors.
What we lose in gravity and unity is made up for
by versatility. Euripides, to use a modern phrase, is more sensational
than either &AElig;schylus or Sophocles. Aristotle called him
&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, by which he probably meant that he was most profuse
of touching and exciting scenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The same tendencies strike us in the more formal department
of the tragic art. Here, as elsewhere, Euripides moves a step beyond
Sophocles, breaking the perfection of poetic harmony for
the sake of novelty and effect. Euripides condescended to stage
tricks. It is well known how Aristophanes laughed at him for
the presentation of shabby-genteel princes and monarchs out-at-elbow.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Having no deep tragic destiny for the groundwork of
his drama, he sought to touch the spectators by royalty in ruins
and wealth reduced to beggary. The gorgeous scenic shows in
which &AElig;schylus had delighted, but which he had invariably subordinated
to his subject, and which Sophocles, with the tact of a
supreme master in beauty, had managed to dispense with, were
lavished by Euripides. One play of his, the <i>Troades</i>, has absolutely
no plot. Such attraction as it possesses it owes to the
rapid succession of pathetic situations and splendid scenes, the
whole closing with the burning of the towers of Troy.</p>

<p>By curtailing the function of the Chorus, Euripides separated
from the action of the drama that element which in &AElig;schylus
had been chiefly useful for the inculcation of the moral of the
play. On the other hand, by expanding the function of the
Messenger he was able to indulge his faculty for brilliant description.
It has been well said, that the ear and not the eye
was the chosen vehicle of pathos to the Greeks. This remark is
fully justified by the narrative passages in the plays of Euripides&mdash;passages
of poetry unsurpassed for radiance, swiftness, strength,
pictorial effect. The account of the Bacchic revels among the
mountains of Cith&aelig;ron, and of the death of Pentheus in the
<i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, that of the death of Glauke in <i>Medea</i>, and of Hippolytus
in the play that bears his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>, that of the sacrifice of
Polyxena in the <i>Hecuba</i>, that of Orestes and Pylades laying
hands on Helen in the <i>Orestes</i>, and many others, prove with
what consummate skill the third of the great tragic poets seized
upon a field within the legitimate province of his art as yet but
imperfectly occupied by his predecessors.</p>

<p>Another novelty was the use of the prologue. Here, again,
Euripides expanded the already existing elements in Greek tragedy
beyond their power of enduring the strain he put upon them.
In their drama the Greek poets did not aim at surprise; the
spectators were expected to be familiar beforehand with the subject
of the play. But when the plot became more complicated
and the incidents more varied under the hands of Euripides, a
prologue was the natural expedient, in perfect harmony with the
stationary character of Greek tragedy, for placing the audience
at the point of view intended by the poets.</p>

<p>The solution of the tragic situation by the intervention of a
god at the conclusion of the play, familiarly known as the <i>deus
ex machin&acirc;</i>, was too frequently adopted by Euripides. The
speeches of these divine beings are always formal and uninteresting.
Their interference is felt to be mechanical, and the settlement
of human difficulties effected by them leaves an ineffaceable
impression of littleness. It reminds us of that pinch of
dust upon the warring hive which Virgil described with exquisite
irony. The <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> existed potentially in previous
Greek tragedy, and Euripides is less to be blamed for the employment
of this device than for the abuse of it. He did not
take enough pains to prepare for the appearance of the deity by
dramatic motives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> and he had recourse to it too often. It is
probable that the theatrical effect gratified his audience, and prevented
them from calling in question the artistic justification of
so novel and exciting a stage spectacle.</p>

<p>In all these changes it will be evident that Euripides, wisely
or unwisely, obtained originality by carrying his art beyond the
point which it had reached under his predecessors. Using a
simile, we might compare the drama of &AElig;schylus to the sublime
but rugged architecture which is called Norman, that of
Sophocles to the most refined and perfect pointed style, that of
Euripides to a highly decorated&mdash;florid and flamboyant&mdash;manner.
&AElig;schylus aimed at durability of structure, at singleness
and grandeur of effect. Sophocles added the utmost elegance
and finish. Euripides neglected force of construction and unity
of design for ornament and brilliancy of effect. But he added
something of his own, something infinitely precious and enduringly
attractive. The fault of his style consisted in a too exclusive
attention to the parts. We are also often made to feel
that he fails by not concentrating his whole strength upon the
artistic motives of his plays. He has too many side-thrusts at
political and ethical questions, too many speculative and critical
digressions, too much logomachy and metaphysical debate.</p>

<p>The object of the foregoing remarks has been to show how
and to what extent Euripides departed from the form and essence
of Greek tragedy. It may sound paradoxical now to assert that
it was a merit in him rather than a defect to have sacrificed the
unity of art to the development of subordinate beauties. Yet it
seems to me that in no other way could the successor of &AElig;schylus
and Sophocles have made himself the true exponent of his
age, have expanded to the full the faculties still l<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>atent in Greek
tragedy, or have failed to "affect the fame of an imitator." The
law of inevitable progression in art, from the severe and animated
embodiment of an idea to the conscious elaboration of merely
&aelig;sthetic motives and brilliant episodes, has hitherto been neglected
by the critics and historians of poetry. They do not observe
that the first impulse in a people towards creativeness is some
deep and serious emotion, some fixed point of religious enthusiasm
or national pride. To give adequate form to this taxes the
energies of the first generation of artists, and raises their poetic
faculty, by the admixture of prophetic inspiration, to the highest
pitch. After the original passion for the ideas to be embodied in
art has somewhat subsided, but before the glow and fire of enthusiasm
have faded out, there comes a second period, when art is
studied more for art's sake, but when the generative potency of
the earlier poets is by no means exhausted. For a moment the
artist at this juncture is priest, prophet, hierophant, and charmer,
all in one. More conscious of the laws of beauty than his predecessors,
he makes some sacrifice of the idea to meet the requirements
of pure art; but he never forgets that beauty by itself is
insufficient to a great and perfect work, nor has he lost his interest
in the cardinal conceptions which vitalize the most majestic
poetry. During the first and second phases which I have indicated,
the genius of a nation throws out a number of masterpieces&mdash;some
of them rough-hewn and Cyclopean, others perfect in
their combination of the strength of thought with grace and elevated
beauty. But the mine of ideas is exhausted. The national
taste has been educated. Conceptions which were novel to the
grandparents have become the intellectual atmosphere of the
grandchildren. It is now impossible to return upon the past&mdash;to
gild the refined gold, or to paint the lily of the supreme poets.
Their vigor may survive in their suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>cessors; but their inspiration
has taken form forever in their poems. What, then, remains for
the third generation of artists? They have either to reproduce
their models&mdash;and this is stifling to true genius; or they have to
seek novelty at the risk of impairing the strength or the beauty
which has become stereotyped. Less deeply interested in the
great ideas by which they have been educated, and of which they
are in no sense the creators, incapable of competing on the old
ground with their elders, they are obliged to go afield for striking
situations, to force sentiment and pathos, to subordinate the harmony
of the whole to the melody of the parts, to sink the prophet
in the poet, the hierophant in the charmer.</p>

<p>This law of sequence is widely applicable. It will be seen to
control the history of all uninterrupted artistic dynasties. Greek
sculpture, for example, passes from the austere, through the perfect,
to the simply elegant. The artist of the &AElig;ginetan pediment
was wholly intent upon the faithful representation of heroic incidents.
The event filled his mind: he sought to express it as energetically
as he could. Pheidias stands on the ground of accomplished
art. The mythus selected for treatment is developed
with perfect fidelity, but also with regard to &aelig;sthetical effect.
Praxiteles neglects the event, the substance of the mythus. His
interest in that has languished, and has been supplanted by enthusiasm
for mere forms of beauty. He lavishes a Pheidian wealth
of genius on separate figures and situations of no great import except
for their consummate loveliness. In architecture, the genealogy
of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders points to the
same law. Take another instance from modern painting. Giotto,
Raphael, Correggio, differ less perhaps in actual calibre than in
relative historical position. Giotto, intent upon the fundamental
ideas of Christian mythology, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>termines to express them forcibly,
faithfully, earnestly, without regarding aught but the best method
of investing them with harmony, lucidity, and dignity. Raphael
ascends a step, and combines the strength and purity of Giotto
with elaborate beauty and classic finish of style. Correggio at his
appearance finds all the great work done. The Christian mythus
has been adequately set forth by his predecessors. He is driven
to become the thaumaturgist of chiaroscuro, the audacious violator
of unity in composition, the supreme painter of erotic paradise.
Further development of the religious idea beyond that
achieved by Raphael was impossible. Already in Raphael's work
a compromise between religious austerity and pagan grace had
been observable. The simplicity of Giotto was gone beyond recapture.
Correggio could only be original by carrying onward to
its ultimate perfection the element of beauty for its own sake introduced
by Raphael. Like Euripides, Correggio was condemned
to the misfortune of separating beauty from the idea, the body
from the spirit. With them the forces inherent in the germs of
their respective arts were exhausted. But those who rightly understand
them must, we imagine, be prepared to accept with gratitude
the existence of Correggio and Euripides, both as complementing
Giotto and &AElig;schylus, and also as accounting for the meridian
splendor of Sophocles and Raphael. Without the cadence
of Euripides the majestic aria of Sophocles would hardly be played
out. By studying the Correggiosity of Correggio we comprehend
how much of mere &aelig;sthetic beauty is held in solution in the
work of Raphael. It is thus, as it were, that, like projectiles, arts
describe their parabolas and end.</p>

<p>To return in detail to the Greek tragedians. &AElig;schylus determines
at all hazards to exhibit the chosen m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ythus in its entirety,
and to give full prominence to his religious idea. Hence we have
to put up with much that is tedious&mdash;a whole <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>, for example.
But hence the unrivalled majesty of the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
Sophocles manipulates his subject more artistically, so as to make
it harmonious without losing sight of its internal source of unity.
But he already begins to disintegrate the colossal work of &AElig;schylus&mdash;notably
in his separation of the trilogy and in his moralizing
of the idea of Nemesis. With Euripides the disintegration
is complete. He neglects the mythus altogether. The theosophy
of &AElig;schylus, always implicit in Sophocles, survives as a
mere conventionality in the work of Euripides. Finally, like Praxiteles,
he carves single statues of eminent beauty; like Correggio,
he conceals his poverty of design beneath a mass of redundant
elegance. What we have really to regret in the art of Euripides
is that he should have endeavored to compete at all with &AElig;schylus
and Sophocles upon the old ground of the tales of Thebes and
Troy. Where he breaks new ground, as in the <i>Medea</i>, the <i>Hippolytus</i>,
and the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, he proves himself a consummate master.
Here the novelty of his method shocks no sense of traditional
propriety. He is not driven to flippant paradox or sarcastic scepticism
in dealing with time-honored myths, or to travesties of
well-marked characters, in order to assert his individuality. These
plays exhibit a complete unity of outward form, and a profound
inte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>rnal unity of passion and character. They are not surpassed
in their own kind by anything that any other poet had produced;
and if "the <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i> be adequate to the <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i>," Euripides
may here be pronounced the rival of Sophocles and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>To enter into an elaborate analysis of Euripides as a poet would
be beyond the scope of this essay, which has for its subject the
relation of the third great dramatist to his predecessors and to
Greek tragedy in general. Yet something must be added to justify
the opinion just expressed, that, though Euripides suffered by
the constraint under which he labored in competition with rivals
who had nearly exhausted the resources of the tragic art, yet he
displays beauties of his own of such transcendent merit as to place
him in the first rank of the poets of the world. It would be a
delightful task to attempt to do him justice in the teeth of a malevolent
generation of critics, led by Schlegel and M&uuml;ller, who do
not understand him&mdash;to summon from the shadows of the Attic
stage the "magnificent witch" Medea, pure-souled Polyxena, wifely
Alcestis, fiery-hearted Ph&aelig;dra, chaste and cold Hippolytus, Andromache
upon her chariot a royal slave, Orestes in his agony
soothed by a sister's ministrations, the sunny piety of Ion, the
self-devotion of Menoikeus&mdash;intermingling perchance these pictured
forms, pure, statuesque and clear as frescos from Pompeii,
with choric odes and exquisite descriptions. The lyrics of Euripides
are among the choicest treasures of Greek poetry: they flow
like mountain rivulets flashing with sunbeams, eddying in cool,
shady places, rustling through leaves of mint, forget-me-not,
marsh-marigold, and dock. His landscapes are most vivid: in
ancient poetry there is nothing to compete with the pictures of
Cith&aelig;ron, where the Bacchantes lie limb-length beneath the silver-firs,
their snakes asleep, and the mountain air ruffling their
loose curls; or with the cave of Polyphemus, where the satyrs
lead their flocks from pasture up the valley between stone-pine
and chestnut-tree to the lawns that overhang dark purple sea-waves.
In the department of the picturesque Euripides is unrivalled.
His paintings have the truth to nature, the delic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ately
modulated outline, and the facile grace of the most perfect bass-reliefs
or frescos.</p>

<p>But to attempt this labor of criticism would be to write a book
upon Euripides. It must be enough in this place to illustrate one
quality which occupies a large space in the dramatic ethics of Euripides,
and forms the motive of the action of his leading characters.
The old religious basis of Nemesis having been virtually
abandoned by him, Euripides fell back upon the morality of passions
and emotions. For his cardinal virtue he chose what the
Greeks call &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;, stoutheartedness, pluck in the noblest sense
of the word&mdash;that temper of the soul which prepared the individual
to sacrifice himself for the State, and to triumph in pain or
death or dogged endurance rather than give way to feebler instincts.
That this quality should be prominent in Euripides is
not without significance. Not only did it enable him to construct
most thrilling scenes: it also harmonized with the advancing tendencies
of Greek philosophy, which already held within itself the
germs of Stoicism&mdash;or the theory of &#954;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8055;&#945;.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But in his dramatic
handling of the motive he softened its harder outlines by
touches of exquisite unselfishness, converting adamantine firmness
into almost tremulous devotion. One of the most pathetic exhibitions
of this virtue occurs in the <i>Ph&#339;niss&aelig;</i>. The Seven Captains
are beleaguering Thebes, and affairs are going ill with the
garrison. Teiresias, however, prophesies that if Creon's son, Menoikeus,
will kill himself, Thebes must triumph. Creon accepts
the prophecy, but seeks to save his son; he sends for Menoikeus
and instructs him how he may escape to Dodona. Menoikeus
pretends to agree with what his father counsels, and, after true
Euripidean fashion, sends Creon to get his journey-money. Then
the boy, left alone upon the stage, turns to the Chorus and begins
his speech:</p>

<p>With the <i>Ph&#339;niss&aelig;</i> in our hands, one other passage may be
translated which displays the power possessed by Euripides of
composing a dramatic picture, and presenting pathos to the eye.
Eteocles and Polyneices have been wounded to the death. Jocasta,
their mother, and Antigone, their sister, go forth to the battlefield
to find them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then rushed their wretched mother on the twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeing them thus wounded unto death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailed: "O my sons! too late, too late I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To succor you!" Then, clasping them by turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept and mourned the long toil of her breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groaning; and by her side their sister groaned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O ye who should have been my mother's stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In age, O, thoughtless of my maiden years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwedded, dearest brothers!" From his chest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving a heavy breath, King Eteocles heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother, and stretched forth a cold damp hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On hers, and nothing said, but with his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake to her by his tears, showing kind thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In symbols. Then the other, who still breathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at his sister, and the queen, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We have perished, mother! yea, I pity thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And fare you well! Now darkness clips me round."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But to return to the virtue of &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;. The play of <i>Hecuba</i>
contains a still more touching picture of heroism in death than
that displayed by Menoikeus. Troy has been taken. Ulysses is
sent by the Greeks to inform Hecuba that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> daughter Polyxena
must be sacrificed. Hecuba reminds him how in former days he
had come disguised as a spy to Troy, and how she had recognized
him, and, at his strong entreaty, spared him from discovery. In
return for this, let him now spare her daughter. Frigidly and
politely Ulysses replies, "True, lady, a life for a life. You saved
mine, I would do something to save yours; but your daughter is
quite another person. I have not the pleasure of having received
benefits from her. I must trouble her to follow me." Then
Polyxena breaks silence:</p>

<span class="i0">For my part. I will rise and follow thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by strong need; yea, and not loath to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! if I should not seek death, I were found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cowardly, life-loving, selfish soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For why should I live? Was my sire not king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all broad Phrygia? Thus my life began;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was I nurtured on fair bloom of hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the bride of kings; no small the suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ween, of lovers seeking me: thus I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was once&mdash;ah, woe is me! of Idan dames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mistress and queen, 'mid maidens like a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conspicuous, peer of gods, except for death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I am a slave: this name alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes me in love with death&mdash;so strange it is.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sheer contempt of life, when life has to be accepted on dishonorable
terms, is the virt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ue of Polyxena. But, so far, though we
may admire her fortitude, we have not been touched by her misfortune.
Euripides reserves the pathos, after his own fashion, for
a picture. Talthybius, the herald, is telling Hecuba how her
daughter died:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The whole vast concourse of the Achaian host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood round the tomb to see your daughter die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilleus' son taking her by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed her upon the mound, and I stayed near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youths, the flower of Greece, a chosen few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands to check thy heifer, should she bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attended. From a cup of carven gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised full of wine, Achilleus' son poured forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libation to his sire, and bade me sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence throughout the whole Achaian host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, standing there, cried in the midst these words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Silence, Achaians! let the host be still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush hold your voices!" Breathless stayed the crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he: "O son of Peleus, father mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take these libations pleasant to thy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draughts that allure the dead: come, drink the black<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And let our barks go free; give safe return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward from Troy to all, and happy voyage."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such words he spake, and the crowd prayed assent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from the scabbard, by its golden hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drew the sword, and to the chosen youths<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Signalled that they should bring the maid; but she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing her hour was come, spake thus, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O men of Argus who have sacked my town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, of free will I die! let no man touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My body: boldly will I stretch my throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but I pray you set me free, then slay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That free I thus may perish: 'mong the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a queen, I blush to be called slave."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people shouted, and King Agamemnon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade the youths loose the maid, and set her free:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, when she heard the order of the chiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seizing her mantle, from the shoulder down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the soft centre of her snowy waist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tore it, and showed her breasts and bosom fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a statue. Bending then with knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth, she spake a speech most piteous:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"See you this breast, oh! youth, if breast you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike it; take heart: or if beneath my neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! here my throat is ready for your sword!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He willing not, yet willing, pity-stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow for the maiden, with his blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severed the channels of her breath: blood flowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, though dying, still had thought to fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In seemly wise hiding what eyes should see not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she breathed her life out from the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was the Argive host in divers way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of service parted; for some bringing leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewed them upon the corpse; some piled a pyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragging pine trunks and boughs; and he who bore none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard from the bearers many a bitter word:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Standest thou, villain? Hast thou then no robe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No funeral honors for the maid to bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not go and get for her who died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most nobly, bravest-souled, some gift?" Thus they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake of thy child in death: "O thou most blessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of women in thy daughter, most undone!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The quality of &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945; which we have seen in Menoikeus and
Polyxena is displayed by Macaria in the <i>Heracleid&aelig;</i> and by Iphigenia
in the last scene of her tragedy at Aulis. Iphigenia in this
play ranks justly as the most beautiful of Euripidean characters,
and as the most truly feminine among the heroines of the Greek
drama. Her first appearance on the stage enlists our sympathy,
when she seems to welcome her father&mdash;the father whom we know
to be ignobly and deceitfully planning her death&mdash;with the tenderest
words of girlish greeting. Landor, in his celebrated dialogue
between Agamemnon and his daughter, on the shores of
Lethe, was mindful of this passage. But in that masterly study
of Greek style he added a new element of pathos. Iphigenia has
already drunk the waters of oblivion, and all the anguish of the
past, her father's treachery, and the bending of his will in base
compliance with a barbarous superstition, has been forgotten.
Meanwhile Agamemnon has not only his daughter's wrongs upon
his conscience, but Clytemnestra's adultery and vengeance, the
price he paid for his old crime, are still hot in his memory.
Therefore the situation is more complex in the modern poem. At
Aulis, Iphigenia is but the loved child of a weak man, who has to
return her p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>retty speeches and caresses with constrained phrases
hiding a hideous meaning. When the truth is at last made known
to her she pleads passionately for life. "Had I the tongue of
Orpheus," she cries in her agony, "I would melt your heart to
pity, father, with my words. But now my only eloquence is
tears. I was the first who called you father, the first you called
your child; the first who sat upon your knees and took and gave
a daughter's kisses." She reminds him of his promises, the happy
life she was to lead, the comfort she meant to bring to his old
age. She asks what Helen and Paris have to do with her, or she
with them, that she should perish in their quarrel. She makes
the little Orestes kneel and clasp his hands in speechless prayer.
At last the whole energy of her grief finds vent in words more
thrilling even than Claudio's when he thinks of death: "Of all
the joys that men can have, the sweetest is to live and see the
light. The dead are nothing; only madmen pray for death; it
is better to live miserably than to die gloriously." The effect of
these passionate entreaties and of the lyrical outburst of anguish
which follows is to make us feel the price of Iphigenia's sacrifice.
She is no forlorn captive like Polyxena, but a princess in the very
bloom and promise of her prime, affianced to Achilles, just entering
upon the sweetness of new life divined "in rich foreshadowings
of the world." How can she leave it all and go forth to dust
and endless darkness? Yet her father has dropped one word
which in her first passion of grief seems to be unheeded. "Hellas
requires this of us both, my daughter&mdash;of you as far as in you
lies, and of me also, in order that she should be free." When we
next behold Iphigenia, his words had borne noble fruit. Clytemnestra
and Achilles are devising how to save her. She enters, firm
and resolute, but with the rapid utterance of exalted enthusiasm.
Her determination has been taken. The du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ty laid upon her, the
greatness of the glory, the grandeur of the part she has to play,
had reconciled her to death. "Mother, listen to my words! The
whole of mighty Hellas looks to me for her salvation and her freedom.
How, then, should I be so life-loving as to shrink? And
you, you did not bear me for yourself alone, but for all Greece.
I give this my body for our land. Slay me; destroy the towers
of Ilion. This shall be my everlasting monument, and this my
children and my marriage and my fame." What follows in her
dialogue with Clytemnestra and Achilles, Clytemnestra vainly seeking
to overthrow her resolution, and Achilles blending his admiration
of her heroism with regret that he should lose this flower
of royalty, raises the unselfish passion of the girl to still sublimer
height. She is not only firm, but exquisitely gentle. She thinks
of her brother, whom she leaves behind. She entreats her mother
to forgive Agamemnon. And even when she breaks into lamentation,
her one sustaining thought remains, that she, she only,
will overwhelm Troy, and bring the light of safety and of freedom
upon Hellas. Here, then, in the &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945; of Iphigenia, the
antique thirst for glory is the determining motive; and her final
resolution contradicts that first outcry of simple nature uttered to
her father. The spiritual element, aflame with hope of everlasting
honor, discards the cruder instincts that make men cling to
life for life's sake only.</p>

<p>Another shade of the same virtue gives a peculiar attraction to
the self-devotion of Alcestis in her death, and of Electra in her attendance
on the brain-sick Orestes. Blending with the despair of
the captive princess and the frenzy of the inspired Pythia, this
sublime unselfishness renders Cassandra's attitude in the <i>Troades</i>
heroically tragic. She goes, a bondwoman, an unwilling concubine,
with Agamemnon to Mycen&aelig;. Insult and slavery and a
horrible death, clearly discerned by her prophetic vis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ion, are before
her. And yet she triumphs gloriously; her voice rings like
a clarion when she proclaims that the guerdon of her suffering is
the ruin of the house of Atreus. It is noticeable that Euripides,
the so-called woman-hater, has alone of the Greek poets subsequent
to Homer, with the single exception of Sophocles, devoted
his genius to the delineation of female characters. It is impossible
to weigh occasional sententious sarcasms against such careful
studies of heroic virtue in woman as the Iphigenia, the Electra,
the Polyxena, the Alcestis of our poet. Aristophanes, who was
himself the worst enemy Athenian ladies ever met with, describes
Euripides as a foe to women, apparently because he thought fit to
treat them, not as automata, but as active, passionate, and powerful
agents in the play of human life.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>But to return to our illustrations of &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;. In the <i>Medea</i>
and the <i>Hippolytus</i> Euripides again displays this virtue of stern
stoicism in two women. But here the heroines are guilty: their
Spartan endurance of anguish to the death is tempered with crime.
These tragedies are the masterpieces of the poet; in each of them
the single passion of an individual forms the subject of the drama.
Separated from all antecedents of ancestral doom, Medea and
Ph&aelig;dra work out the dreadful consequences of their own tempestuous
will. Not <i>Othello</i>, and not <i>Faust</i>, have a more complete
internal unity of motive. No modern play has an equal external
harmony of form. Medea was one of the most romantic figures
of Greek story. Daughter of the sun-god in the Colchian land of
mystery and magic, she unfolded like some poisonous flower, gorgeous
to look upon, with flaunting petals and intoxicating scent,
but deadly. Terrible indeed in wiles, she learned to love Jason.
By a series of crimes, in which the hero participated as her accomplice,
and of which he reaped the benefits&mdash;by the betrayal
of her father's trust, by the murder of her brother, by the butchery
of Pelias&mdash;she placed her lover on the throne of Thessaly.
Then Jason, at the height of his prosperity, forgetting the love,
as of some tigress, that the sorceress bore him, forgetting, too, her
fatal power of life and death, cast his eyes on Glauke, the king's
daughter of Corinth, and bade Medea go forth with her sons,
a pariah&mdash;a dishonored wife. Whither should sh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>e turn? To
Colchis, and the father whose son she slew? To Thessaly, where
the friends of Pelias still live? Jason does not care. His passion
for Medea has vanished like a mist. Their common trials
common crimes&mdash;trials which should have endeared them to each
other; crimes which were as strong as hell to bind them&mdash;have
melted from his mind like dew. He only wishes to be rid of the
fell woman, and to live a peaceful life with innocent home-keeping
folk. But on one thing Jason has not reckoned&mdash;on the awful
fury of his old love; he forgets how she wrought by magic
and by poison in his need, and how in her own need she may do
things terrible and strange. In the same way we often think
that we will lightly leave some ancient, strong, habitual sin, of old
time passionately cherished, of late grown burdensome; but not
so easily may the new pure life be won. Between our souls and
it there stands the fury of the past.</p>

<p>Medea in her house, like a lioness in her den, has crouched
sleepless, without food, not to be touched or spoken to, since the
first news of Glauke's projected bridal was told. No one knows
what she is meditating. Only the nurse of her children mistrusts
her fiery eyes and thunderous silence, her viperish loose hair and
throbbing skin. The moment is finely prepared. Some Corinthian
ladies visit her, and she, though loath to rise, does so at their
prayer, excusing her reluctance by illness, and by a foreigner's
want of familiarity with their customs. Pale, calm, and terrible,
she stands before them. From this first appearance of Medea to
the end of the play, her one figure occupies the whole space of
the theatre. Her spirit is in the air, and the progress of the action
only dilates the impression which she has produced. The
altercations with Creon and with Jason are artfully conducted so
as to arouse our sympathy and make us feel that such a nature is
being driven by the intemperance and selfishness of others into
a <i>cul-de-sac</i> of crime. The facility with which she disposes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>thought of her chief foes, as if they were so many flies that have
to be caught and killed, is eminently impressive. "Many are the
ways of death: I will stretch three corpses in the palace&mdash;Creon's,
the bride's, my husband's. My only thought is now of means&mdash;whether
to burn them or to cut their throats&mdash;perchance the old
tried way of poison were the best. They are dead." &#922;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#8052; &#964;&#949;&#952;&#957;&#8118;&#963;&#953;.
Medea knows <i>they</i> cannot escape her. For the rest, she
will consider her own plans. In the scene with Jason she rises
to an appalling altitude. Her words are winged snakes and the
breath of furnaces. There is no querulous recrimination, no impotence
of anger; but her spirit glows and flickers dragon-like
against him, as she stands above him on the pedestal of his ingratitude.
But when he has gone, and she sits down to reconsider
her last act of vengeance&mdash;the murder of his sons and hers&mdash;then
begins the tragic agony of her own soul. These lines reveal
the contest between a mother's love and the pride of an injured
woman, the &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945; of one who must steel her heart in
order to preserve her fame for fortitude and power:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Zeus, and justice of high Jove, and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sun, all seeing! Now victorious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my foes shall I pace forth, sweet friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To triumph!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shudder at the deed that will be done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter: for my children I shall slay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine; there is none shall snatch them from me now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no one deem me timid, weak of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placidly tame; but of the other temper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh to my foes and kindly to my friends.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then when Glauke, arrayed in the robe Medea sent her, is
smouldering to ashes with her father in slow phosphorescent
flame, Medea sends for her children <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>and makes that last speech
which is the very triumph of Euripidean rhetoric:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Ph&aelig;dra, the heroine of the <i>Hippolytus</i>, supplies us with a new
conception of the same thirst for &#949;&#8016;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&mdash;the same &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;, &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;,
indifference to life when honor is at stake. The pride of
her good name drives Ph&aelig;dra to a crime more detestable than
Medea's, because her victim, Hippolytus, is eminently innocent. I
do not want to dwell upon the pining sickness of Ph&aelig;dra, which
Euripides has wrought with exquisitely painful details, but rather
to call attention to Hippolytus. Side by side with the fever of
Ph&aelig;dra is the pure fresh health of the hunter-hero. The scent
of forest-glades, where he pursues the deer with Artemis, surrounds
him; the sea-breeze from the sands, where he trains his
horses, moves his curls. His piety is as untainted as his purity;
it is the maiden-service of a maiden-saint. In his observance of
the oath extorted from him by Ph&aelig;dra's nurse, in his obedience
to his father's will, in his kindness to his servants, in his gentle
endurance of a painful death, and in the joy with which he greets
the virgin huntress when she comes to visit him, Euripides has
firmly traced the ideal of a guileless, tranquil manhood. Hippolytus
among the ancients was the Paladin of chastity, the Percival
of their romance. Nor is any knight of medi&aelig;val legend
more true and pure than he. Hippolytus first comes upon the
stage with a garland of wild flowers for Artemis:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady, for thee this garland have I woven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wilding flowers plucked from an unshorn meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where neither shepherd dares to feed his flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever scythe hath swept, but through the mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unshorn in spring the bee pursues her labors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maiden modesty with running rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters the garden. Sweet queen, take my crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deck thy golden hair: my hand is holy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me alone of men belongs this honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be with thee and answer when thou speakest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, for I hear thy voice but do not see thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may I end my life as I began.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even in this bald translation some of the fresh morning feeling,
as of cool fields and living waters, and pure companionship and a
heart at peace, transpires. Throughout the play, in spite of the
usual Euripidean blemishes of smart logic-chopping and pragmatical
sententiousness, this impression is maintained. Hippolytus
moves through it with the athletic charm that belongs to such
statues as that of Meleager and his dog in the Vatican. At the
end the young hero is carried from the sea-beach, mangled, and
panting out his life amid intolerable pain and fever-thirst. His
lamentations are loud and deep as he calls on Death the healer.
Then suddenly is he aware of the presence of Artemis:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Hippolytus: 'twas fate that ruined thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Artemis reconciles father and son. Hippolytus dies slowly
in the arms of Theseus, and the play ends. The appearance of
the goddess, as a lady of transcendent power more than as a divine
being&mdash;her vindictive hatred of Aphrodite, and the moral
that she draws about the fate by which Hippolytus died and Theseus
sinned, are all thoroughly Euripidean. Not so would &AElig;schylus
the theologian, or Sophocles the mora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>list, have dealt with the
conclusion of the play. But neither would have drawn a more
touching picture.</p>

<p>The following scene from the opening of the <i>Orestes</i> may be
taken as a complete specimen of the manner of Euripides when
working pathos to its highest pitch, and when desirous of introducing
into mythic history the realities of common life. Electra
appears as the devoted sister; Orestes as the invalid brother; the
Chorus are somewhat importunate, but, at the same time, sympathetic
visitors. This extract also serves to illustrate the Euripidean
habit of mingling lyrical dialogue with the more regular
Iambic in passages which do not exactly correspond to the Commos
of the elder tragedians, but which require highly wrought expression.
Helen has just left Electra. As the wife of Menelaus
walks away, the daughter of Agamemnon follows her with her
eyes, and speaks thus:</p>

<p>This scene, for variety of motive and effect, is not excelled by
any passage in ancient tragedy. The scope which it afforded
for impressive acting must have been immense, though it is difficult
to un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>derstand how the fixed masks and conventional dresses
of the Greek stage could have been adapted to the violent and
frequent changes of mood exhibited by Orestes. Adequately to
render the effect of the lyrical dialogue between Electra and the
Chorus is very difficult. I have attempted to maintain in some
degree the antistrophic pauses, and by the use of rhyme to hint
how very near the tragedy of the Greeks approached, in scenes
like this, to the Italian opera. The entrance of the Chorus singing
"Silence" can only be paralleled by passages in which the
spies or conspirators of Rossini or Mozart appear upon the stage,
whispering "Zitto! Zitto!" to the sound of subdued music. In
the same way Electra's impassioned apostrophe to Night must
have been the subject of an elaborate aria.</p>

<p>The scene which I have translated from the <i>Orestes</i> suggests
the remark that many Euripidean plays were in fact melodramas.
This is true, in a special sense, of the <i>Troades</i>, which must have
owed its interest as an acted drama to the music and the <i>mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i>. It is also worthy of notice that a fair proportion of our
extant tragedies are what the Germans call <i>Lustspiele</i>. That is to
say, they have no proper tragic ending, and the element of tragedy
contained in them consists of perils escaped by the chief actors.
Thus the <i>Helena</i> and the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> have a joyful
climax. The <i>Orestes</i> closes with a reconciliation of all parties,
hurriedly effected, that reminds us of a modern comedy. The
<i>Ion</i> is brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The apotheosis of
Iphigenia in her play at Aulis eliminates the tragic element,
though, regarded as the first part of an eminently tragic series
and read by the light of the <i>Electra</i>, this play ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>y be regarded as
the prologue to a mighty drama of crime and retribution. The
<i>Alcestis</i> is now universally and rightly classed among the plays of
a semi-satyric character; and the <i>Andromache</i> is not a genuine
tragedy, since the death of Neoptolemus is episodical and has
little to do with the previous action. In all these plays the key-note
is struck by the Greek phrase &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#951;, which signified a
revolution brought about within the limits of a certain situation.
This probably attracted Euripides to the class of drama in question,
since it enabled him to deal freely with character and to
concentrate his attention upon the working out of striking incidents.
From this point of view the <i>Andromache</i> is so important
that it deserves more than a passing notice. The peculiar faculty
and the prevailing faults of the poet are alike illustrated in its
scenes&mdash;his fine and sharp character-making in the chief personages,
his powerful rhetoric and subtle special-pleading, his acute
remarks on politics and domestic relations, no less than his wilful
neglect of dramatic unity and wanton carelessness of construction.
Viewed in one light, the <i>Andromache</i> is a bitter satire
upon the Spartan type of character, exemplified in the cruel Hermione
and the treacherous Menelaus. From yet another standpoint
of criticism it may be regarded as a dramatic essay on the
choice of wives and the economy of the household. Thus the
political and social theorist overlays the artist proper in this play;
and yet the language is so brilliant, the pathos is so telling, and
the lyrical episodes are so musical that we understand its popularity
among the ancients. At the opening of the drama, Andromache,
who has taken sanctuary at Phthia in the shrine of Thetis,
describes the misery of her situation as bondwoman and concubine
to Neoptolemus. Though warmly attached to herself and
the father of her son Molossus, he has recently married Hermione,
the Spartan princess. Thus the true subject <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>of the play is set
before us; for if the <i>Andromache</i> has any unity of conception,
we must find it in the "nuptial choice" of Neoptolemus, who, after
bringing discord into his household by the jealousy of two
women, eventually meets his death as an indirect consequence of
this domestic folly. The elegiac lamentations of the Trojan princess
and the tender remonstrances of the Chorus, which follow
the prologue, are among the most melodious passages of poetry
in Euripides. Then the action begins. Neoptolemus is away at
Delphi. Hermione and her father, Menelaus, remain at home, and
use the opportunity for persecuting Andromache. In a long
and agitating scene with Hermione, the heroine shows that she
remains a noble lady, of untamed and royal soul, in spite of slavery.
She disregards all threats, and maintains her station at the
altar, whither she has fled for safety. One menace only makes
her flinch. It is that violence may be done to her child Molossus,
if she will not move. Now Menelaus enters, and the altercations
are repeated, all tending to the same point of proving the
odiousness of the Spartan character and the dignity of Andromache.
Meanwhile our interest in her misfortunes is gradually
heightened; and we tremble for her when at last Menelaus persuades
her to leave the sanctuary by assuring her that the only
way of saving Molossus is to sacrifice her own life. At this point
the pathos of the situation becomes truly Euripidean. We have
the spectacle of a tender and helpless mother in the power of
a merciless tyrant, obliged to give her own life for her son, not
shrinking from the sacrifice, but dreading to leave him unprotected
to his future fate amid unkindly aliens. She rises from the
altar; and no sooner is she in the hands of Menelaus, than he
tells her that his promises were fraudulent. Molossus will be
butchered after all. Then foll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>ows a great scene of high-wrought
feeling. Andromache and Molossus are kneeling before Menelaus
praying for their lives, when Peleus, the aged grandfather of
Neoptolemus, appears and stays the execution. Euripides has
drawn the character of Peleus with something of the heat and
fury of the Sophoclean Teiresias. The old king does not spare
Menelaus, but makes his tongue a scourge to flay him with invective.
The end of the struggle is that Peleus conveys Andromache
and the boy safely away; and during the rest of the drama we
hear nothing of them. Meantime Hermione, who, in contrast to
Andromache's noble firmness and womanhood, is the type of <i>impotentia</i>,
as quick to self-abandonment as she was blind in selfish
cruelty, begins to reflect upon her husband's anger. What will
he say and do if he returns and hears of her intention with regard
to Andromache? She is only just prevented from committing
suicide, and lies sunk in contemptible remorse, when a new
actor appears upon the scene. It is Orestes, to whom Hermione
had been affianced at Argos. The treacherous Menelaus preferred
to give her to a more fortunate and respectable husband;
but Orestes has a mind to wed her still, and has resolved to murder
Neoptolemus at Delphi because of the insult put upon himself.
He therefore removes Hermione from the palace, and departs
for Delphi. Peleus is now left alone upon the stage, to
hear of the murder of his grandson from a messenger, and to receive
instructions from Thetis as to the future of the realm of
Phthia. It will be seen that the construction of this drama is
defective, and that it has two separate plots, the one relating to
Andromache, the other to Hermione and Orestes, which are only
brought into artificial connection by the death of Neoptolemus.
The speedy disappearance of Andromache from the scene, followed
by the flight of Hermione and the escape of Menelaus to
Sparta, leaves Peleus, who is only an accessory ch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>aracter, to bear
the whole burden of the climax. Thus the <i>Andromache</i> lacks both
internal and external unity, the unity of subject and form. Of material
it has plenty, whether we regard the resolutions of fortune
effected for the chief actors, or the variety of incidents, or the richness
of reflective sentences, or the introduction of new "business"
to sustain the flagging interest of the spectators. As a drama, it
is second-rate. As a machine for the exhibition of specifically Euripidean
qualities, it must rank high among the extant tragedies.</p>

<p>The <i>Iphigenia in Aulide</i>, the <i>Electra</i>, the <i>Orestes</i>, and the <i>Iphigenia
in Tauris</i> might be called the Euripidean Oresteia, since
each of these plays treats that portion of the Atridan story which
&AElig;schylus had handled in his three dramas. We miss the final
purification of the hero, and have to infer the climax from the
allusions of the <i>Andromache</i>, where, it may be said in passing,
the noble type of his character, maintained without interruption
in the <i>Electra</i>, the <i>Orestes</i>, and the <i>Tauric Iphigenia</i>, is deformed
by a savagery and guile that must have been repellent even to a
Greek audience. In the <i>Electra</i> Euripides comes immediately
and without doubt consciously into competition with both &AElig;schylus
and Sophocles. Like Sophocles, he has painted Electra as
of harder nature than her brother. When Orestes, before engaging
in his mother's murder, shows signs of yielding to his filial
feeling and expresses a doubt about the oracle, she, like Lady
Macbeth, reanimates his wavering courage with argument and
taunt. But Euripides seems to have felt that it was unnatural in
the Sophoclean drama to represent both brother and sister as unterrified
by conscience after the successful issue of their plot.
The lyrical dialogue between Orestes and Electra, when he returns
with their mother's blood upon his hands and sword, is
both terribl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>y true to nature and dramatically striking. It needs
the appearance of the Dioscuri to confirm them in the faith that
they had done a righteous, heaven-appointed deed of justice. By
this touch Euripides proved his determination to bring even the
most mysterious of legends within the pale of ordinary human
experience. The situation in which he places Electra at the
opening of the play, outcast from her father's palace and wedded
to a farmer, ragged in attire and obliged to do the hard work of
her household, is another and perhaps a less justifiable instance
of his realism. The stirring of compassion by the exhibition of
material misery was one of the points urged against him by Aristophanes;
nor is it possible to feel that Electra's squalor adds
anything essential to her tragedy. We may, however, be thankful
to the poet for the democratic ideal of good manners and true
chivalry, irrespective of blood and accidental breeding, which he
has painted in his portrait of Electra's husband.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Not contented
with thus varying the earlier outlines of the legend, Euripides in
more than one passage directs a covert criticism against his predecessors.
He shows that the tests of his identity offered by Orestes
to Electra in the pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>ys of &AElig;schylus and Sophocles were insufficient,
and that the murder of Clytemnestra in her palace,
surrounded by the guard of a royal household, was improbable.
The new motives invented by him for the recognition of Orestes
and for the withdrawing of the queen to a place where she could
be conveniently despatched are highly ingenious. Yet in the
latter circumstance, what he gained in realism he lost in dramatic
effect; for it was an incident of appalling terror that Clytemnestra
and her paramour should be smitten in those very recesses of
the palace where they had slaughtered Agamemnon, beneath the
influence of those domestic Furies who, like an infernal revel, occupied
the house of Atreus until all the guilty blood was shed.
Throughout the <i>Electra</i> we feel that we are in the presence of a
critical, realistic, and at the same time romantic, poet, who has
embroidered the old material of heroic story with modern casuistry,
and has been working less with a view to producing a masterpiece
of art than with the object of asserting his ingenuity
within the narrow field of an exhausted legend. Had we not the
<i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> and the Sophoclean <i>Electra</i> for standards of comparison,
it is possible that we might do simpler justice to the creative
power of "sad Electra's poet" in this drama. As it is, we can
hardly refrain from treating it as a triumph of skill and reflective
ability, rather than as a potent work of original genius.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Orestes</i> lies open to even more stringent criticism. The
whole conclusion, consisting of the burning of the palace at Argos,
the apotheosis of Helen, the lamentations of the Phrygian
slave, and the betrothal of direst enemies above the ruins of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
ancestral home, is more comic than tragic, and almost justifies the
theory that Euripides intended it to be a parody of some contemporary
drama. This portion of the play, moreover, is a melodrama,
and joins on to the first part by a merely formal link.
Such interest as the <i>Orestes</i> possesses, after the beautiful opening
scene, centres in the heroic friendship of Pylades, who sustains
the hero in his suffering and defends him from the angry folk
of Argos. It is far otherwise with the <i>Tauric Iphigenia</i>. Here
Euripides comes into no competition with &AElig;schylus or Sophocles;
for he has handled a legend outside the sphere of their
known plays. It is one eminently suited to his powers, involving
the description of romantic scenery, the recognition of brother
by sister in circumstances of deep pathos and extreme improbability,
the contest of the most powerful natural feelings, and in
the last place, the exhibition of dangers impending upon all the
chief personages and only avoided by a thoroughly Euripidean
fraud. None of the plots invented by Euripides are so nicely
finished or so rich in incident as this; and yet there is nothing
mechanical in its construction. Few of his plays have choral
passages to match the yearnings of the captive maidens for their
home in Hellas or the praise of young Apollo throned by Zeus
for prophecy beneath Parnassus. Few again are richer or more
truthful in their presentation of emotions&mdash;the exquisite delicacy
of a sister's affection, the loyalty of friends, and the passionate
outpouring of a brother's love. Something in the savage circumstances
of the play, the sombre Tauric scenery, the dreadful rites
of Artemis, to whom Iphigenia has been bound, and the watchful
jealousy of her barbarian king, enhances the beautiful humanity
of those three Greeks, burdened with such weight of sorrow
on a foreign shore, haunted by memories of a father's cruelty,
a mother's infidelity, pursued by the Furies of a righteous but
abominable deed, yet none the less enjoying for one moment in
the midst of pain and peril the pure pleasures of companionship.
The chorus of Hellenic captives maintains an undercurrent of sad
music that still further helps to heighten and interpret the situation.
It is only at the last, when the knot of the situation has
to be cut, that our sympathy begins to fail us. Thoas, though a
barbarian, had been generous and kind. Yet Iphigenia employs
a heartless device for escaping from his hands with the sacred image
of the Tauri in her possession; nor does she feel a moment's
pang of remorse for the pain she is inflicting or for the lies she
has employed to serve her purpose. It may indeed be said generally
that Euripides justified the Aristophanic reproach of meanness
by his too frequent employment of tricks and subterfuges.
These are so distasteful to modern feeling that we are glad to
know that even a Greek critic regarded them as faulty. With
Iphigenia's treason against Thoas we might compare Helen's plot
for deceiving Theoclymenus, the insidious attack of Orestes upon
Neoptolemus at Delphi, the capture of Helen and Hermione by
Orestes and Pylades at Argos, and Agamemnon's incredibly base
lure to Clytemnestra and Iphigenia before Aulis. It is scarcely
a defence of Euripides to urge that the gods themselves, as in the
case of the Tauric Iphigenia, sanction these deceptions. This
only makes the matter worse, and forces us to choose between
two hypotheses&mdash;either that Euripides sought to bring the old
religion into contempt, or that he used its morality for merely
theatrical purposes to justify the romantic crimes of his heroes.
The latter seems the more probable theory; for it is clear in some
most eminent examples that he has treated a deeply immoral legend
for the sake of its admirable artistic capabilities. This is
undoubtedly the case with the <i>Ion</i>, which presents a marvellous
tale of human suffering, adventure, crime, and final felicity, dependent
in all its details upon the fraud of a deity. Without doing
justice to the masterly construction of the plot, the beautiful
poetry, and the sustained interest of the <i>Ion</i>, it may be allowed
me here to dwell for one moment on its morality. Ph&#339;bus begets
the boy Ion by a rape upon Creusa, and steals the boy away
from Athens to Delphi. The mother is left to bewail not her
shame only, but the loss of her son. In course of time she marries
Xuthus and is childless. They go together to Delphi to inquire
of the oracle; and here Xuthus is lyingly informed that
Ion is the son of his youthful years. Rage and jealousy impel
Creusa, on hearing this news, to poison Ion. She fails, and Ion
in revenge attempts to murder her. The danger of Creusa at last
forces Ph&#339;bus to reveal the truth through the mouth of Athene,
who tells the queen that Ion is really her lost son, the offspring
of Apollo's crime. Xuthus happens to be absent during this disclosure,
and the goddess advises Creusa to keep the real truth to
herself, since the good man already supposes Ion to be his own
child, and will consequently treat him like a son. Stripped of its
dramatic ornaments, its wonderful scene-painting, pathetic situations,
unexpected recognitions, sudden catastrophes, accidents and
dangers and adventures, this is the plain legend of the <i>Ion</i>; and
a less ethical story of the gods could scarcely be found among
those which Plato criticised in the <i>Republic</i>.</p>

<p>It is time to return from this digression once more to the plays
which deal with Orestes. In them Euripides painted a virtue dear
in its heroic aspect to the Greeks and celebrated in many of their
legends, but which had not frequently been made the subject of
dramatic presentation. The character of Pylades as the perfect
comrade, fierce as a tiger and cunning as a fox against his foes,
but tender as a woman to his suffering friend, willing to face all
dangers in common with Orestes, enduring for his sake the obloquy
of the world and the mysterious taint of religious impurity,
refusing to live in his death and contending with him for the
right to die, must be accepted as a masterpiece of creative power.
There is nothing in common between Pylades and the confidant
of modern tragedy&mdash;that <i>alter ego</i> or shadow of the hero's self,
who dogs his path and reflects his sentiments. Pylades has a
distinctly separate personality; in the <i>Orestes</i>, when Electra and
her brother have abandoned hope, he takes the initiative and suggests
the scheme that saves them. Yet none the less is sympathy
the main point in his character. Euripides wrote nothing more
touching than the description of his help afforded to Orestes in
the council of the Argives, nothing more sublime than the contest
between the two comrades in the <i>Tauric Iphigenia</i>, when it
is a question which of them should stay and by his own death
save his friend for Hellas. Had the Athenians thus always thought
of friendship, or had they learned the enthusiasm of its ideal from
Euripides, they might indeed have bequeathed a new chivalry to
the world. The three tragedies in which Pylades plays a prominent
part, the <i>Electra</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, and <i>Tauric Iphigenia</i>, are storehouses
of the noblest sentiments and deepest truths about heroic
friendship.</p>

<p>It is hard, while still beneath the overshadowing presence of so
great a master as Euripides, to have patience with the critics and
the scholars who scorn him&mdash;critics who cannot comprehend him,
scholars who have not read him since they were at school. Decadence!
is their cry. Yet what would they have? Would they
ask for a second Sophocles, or a revived &AElig;schylus? That being
clearly impossible, beyond all scope of wish, why will they not be
satisfied with beauty as luminous as that of a Greek statue or a
Greek landscape, with feeling as profound as humanity itself, and
with wisdom "musical as is Apollo's lute?" These are the qualities
of a great poet, and we contend that Euripides possesses
them in an eminent degree. It is false criticism, surely, to do as
Schlegel, M&uuml;ller, and Bunsen have successively done<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;to measure
Euripides by the standard of the success of his predecessors, or to
ransack his plays for illustrations of pet dramatic theories, and
then, because he will not bear these tests, to refuse to see his own
distinguished merits. It would sometimes seem as if ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>r nature
were exhausted by its admiration of a Sophocles or a Shakespeare.
There is no enthusiasm left for Euripides and Fletcher.</p>

<p>Euripides, after all is said, incontestably displays the quality of
radiancy. On this I should be willing to base a portion of his
claim to rank as a great poet. An admirer of &AElig;schylus or Sophocles
might affirm that neither &AElig;schylus nor Sophocles chose to
use their art for the display of thrilling splendor. However that
may be, Euripides, alone of Greeks, with the exception of Aristophanes,
entered the fairyland of dazzling fancy which Calderon
and Shakespeare and Fletcher trod. The <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, like the <i>Birds</i>,
proves what otherwise we might have hardly known, that there
lacked not Greeks for whom the <i>Tempest</i> and <i>A Midsummer-Night's
Dream</i> would have been intelligible. Meanwhile, in making
any estimate of the merits of Euripides, it would be unfair to
omit mention of the enthusiasm felt for him by contemporaries
and posterity. Mr. Browning, in the beautiful monument which
he has erected to the fame of Euripides, has chosen for poetical
treatment the well-known story of Athenians rescued from captivity
by recitation of the verses of their poet.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There is no reason
to doubt a story which attests so strongly to the acceptation
in which Euripides was held at large among the Greeks. Socrates,
again, visited the theatre on the occasion of any representation
of his favorite's plays. By the new comedians, Menander and
Philemon, Euripides was regarded as a divine miracle. Tragedy
and comedy, so dissimilar in their origins, had approximated to a
coalition; tragedy losing its religious dignity, comedy quitting its
obscene though splendid personalities; both meeting on the common
ground of daily life. In the decadence of Greece it was not
&AElig;schylus and Aristophanes, but Euripides and Menander, who
were learned and read and quoted. The colossal theosophemes
of &AElig;schylus called for profound reflec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tion; the Titanic jokes of
Aristophanes taxed the imagination to its utmost stretch. But
Euripides "the human, with his droppings of warm tears," gently
touched and soothed the heart. Menander with his facile wisdom
flattered the intellect of worldly men. The sentences of
both were quotable at large and fit for all occasions. They were
not too great, too lofty, too profound for the paths of common
life. We have lost Menander, alas! but we still possess Euripides.
It seems a strange neglect of good gifts to shut our ears to
his pathetic melodies and ringing eloquence&mdash;because, forsooth,
&AElig;schylus and Sophocles had the advantage of preceding him,
and were superior artists in the bloom and heyday of the young
world's prime.</p>

"To feel and respect a great personality, one must be something one's self.
All those who denied the sublime to Euripides were either poor wretches incapable
of comprehending such sublimity, or shameless charlatans, who, by
their presumption, wished to make more of themselves, and really did make
more of themselves, than they were" (Eckermann's <i>Conversations of Goethe</i>,
English ed., vol. ii. p. 377). In another place he indicates the spirit in which
any adverse criticism of Euripides should be attempted: "A poet whom Socrates
called his friend, whom Aristotle lauded, whom Menander admired, and
for whom Sophocles and the city of Athens put on mourning on hearing of
his death, must certainly have been something. If a modern man like Schlegel
must pick out faults in so great an ancient, he ought only to do it upon
his knees" (<i>ib.</i>, vol. i. p. 378). Again (<i>ib.</i>, vol. i. p. 260), he energetically combats
the opinion that Euripides had caused the decline of Greek tragedy.</p></div>

<p>It is difficult to treat the fragments of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides otherwise than as a golden treasury of saws and
maxims compiled by Alexandrian and Byzantine Greeks, for
whom poetic beauty was of less value than sententious wisdom.
The tragic scope and the &aelig;sthetic handling of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>e fables of their
lost plays can scarcely be conjectured from such slight hints as
we possess. Yet some light may be cast upon the &AElig;schylean
method by observing the titles of his dramas. We have, for example,
the names of a complete tetralogy upon the legend of Lycurgus.
The <i>Edonians</i>, the <i>Bassarids</i>, and the <i>Young Men</i> constituted
a connected series of plays&mdash;a <i>Lycurgeia</i>, with <i>Lycurgus</i>
for the satyric supplement. Remembering that &AElig;schylus called
his own tragedies morsels picked up from the great Homeric banquet-table,
we may conclude that this tetralogy set forth the Dionysian
fable told by Diomede to Glaucus in the <i>Iliad</i> (vi. 131):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No, for not Dryas' son, Lycurgus strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the divine ones fought, on earth lived long.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down the Nyse&iuml;an steep, and the wild throng<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At the man's cry such trembling shook his knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then angered were the gods who live at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Zeus smote blind Lycurgus, and he fell<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that the titles of the three dramas composing the
trilogy were taken from the Chorus. In the first play the Edonian
Thracians, subjects of Lycurgus, formed the Chorus; in the
second, the Bassarids, or nurse-nymphs of Dionysus; in the third,
the youths whom the wine-god had persuaded to adopt his worship.
The subject of the first play was, therefore, the advent of
Dionysus and his following in Thrace, and the victory of Lycurgus
over the new cult. The second set forth the captivity of the
Bacchantes or Bassarids, together with the madness sent upon
Lycurgus as a punishment for his resistance, whereby he was
driven, according to post-Homeric versions of his legend, to the
murder of his own son Dryas in a fit of fury. The third play
carried on the subject by exhibiting the submission of Lycurgus
to the god whom he had disowned and dishonored, and his death,
at t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>he hands of his own subjects, upon Mount Pang&aelig;us. Thus
the first Chorus was hostile to Dionysus; the second was sympathetic,
though captive and impotent; the third was triumphant
in his cause. The artistic sequence of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis
which the trilogy required, was developed through three
moments in the life-drama of Lycurgus, and was typified in the
changes of the choric sympathy, according to the law whereby
&AElig;schylus varied the form of his triple dramas and, at the same
time, immediately connected the Chorus with the passion of each
piece. The tragic interest centred in the conflict of Lycurgus
and the god, and the final solution was afforded by the submission,
though too late, of the protagonist's will to destiny. It is
probable that the satyric play of <i>Lycurgus</i> represented the divine
honors paid, after his death, to the old enemy, now become the
satellite and subject of Dionysus, by pastoral folk and dwellers in
the woodlands. The unification of obstinate antagonistic wills in
the higher will of Zeus or Fate seems in all cases to have supplied
&AElig;schylus with the <i>Vers&ouml;hnung</i> tragedy required, and to
have suggested the religious &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962; without which the Greek
drama would have failed to point its lesson. Seen in this light,
the <i>Lycurgeia</i> must have been a masterpiece only less sublime,
and even more full, perhaps, of picturesque incidents, than the
Promethean trilogy. The emotional complexion, if that phrase
may be permitted, of each member of the trilogy was determined
by the Chorus; wherein we trace a signal instance of the &AElig;schylean
method.</p>

<p>More even to be regretted than the <i>Lycurgeia</i> is a colossal lost
trilogy to which the name of <i>Tragic Iliad</i> has been given. That
&AElig;schylus should have frequently handled the subject-matter of
the <i>Iliad</i> was natural; and many titles of tragedies, quoted singly,
poin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>t to his preoccupation with the mythus of Achilles. It
has, therefore, been conjectured, with fair show of reason, that
the <i>Myrmidons</i>, the <i>Nereids</i>, and the <i>Phrygians</i> formed a triple
drama. The first described the withdrawal of Achilles from the
war, the arming of Patroclus, and the grief which the son of
Peleus felt for his friend's death. No Greek tragedy, had it been
preserved, would have been more precious than this. The second
showed how Thetis comforted her child, and procured fresh armor
for him from Heph&aelig;stus, and how Achilles slew Hector. In
the third, Priam recovered the dead body of his son and buried
it. Supposing the trilogy to have been constructed upon these
outlines, it must have resembled a gigantic history-play, in which,
as in the <i>Iliad</i> itself, the character of Achilles was sufficient to
form the groundwork of a complicated poem. The theme, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>other words, would have resembled those of the modern and romantic
drama, rather than such as the elder Greek poets were in
the habit of choosing. The <i>Achilleis</i> did not in any direct way
illustrate the doctrine of Nemesis, or afford a tragic conflict between
the human will and fate. It owed its lustre to the radiant
beauty of the hero, to the pathos of his love for Patroclus, to the
sudden blazing forth of irresistible energy when sorrow for the
dead had driven him to revenge, and to the tranquillity succeeding
tempest that dignified his generous compliance with the prayers
of Priam. The trilogy composed upon it must, therefore, like
a Shakespearian play, have been a drama of character. The fragments
of the <i>Myrmidones</i> have already been pieced together in
the essay on the Homeric Achilles.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> From the <i>Nereides</i> nothing
has survived except what may be gathered from the meagre remnants
of the Latin version made of it by Attius. The <i>Phrygians</i>,
also called &#7965;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8059;&#964;&#961;&#945;, contained a speech of pleading addressed
by Priam to the hero in his tent, of which the following is a
relic:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The trilogy of which the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> formed probably the
middle play has been sufficiently discussed in the chapter on
&AElig;schylus.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It remains in this place only to notice that the gigantic
geography of the poet received further illustration in the
lost play of the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. "Cette g&eacute;ographie vertigineuse,"
says Victor Hugo, "est m&ecirc;l&eacute;e &agrave; une trag&eacute;die extraordinaire
o&ugrave; l'on entend des dialogues plus qu'humains;" and, inverting
this observation, we may add that the superhuman tragedy
of the <i>Prometheis</i> owed much of its grandeur to the soul-dilating
prospect of the earth's map, outstretched before the far-seeing
sufferer on the crags of Caucasus.</p>

<p>Two other trilogies&mdash;a <i>Danais</i>, composed of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
the <i>Suppliants</i>, and the <i>Danaides</i>; and an <i>&#338;dipodeia</i>, composed
of <i>Laius</i>, the <i>Sphinx</i>, and <i>&#338;dipus</i>&mdash;may be mentioned, though
to recover their outlines with any certainty is now hopeless. For
the rest, it must be enough to transcribe and to translate a few
fragments of singular beauty. Here is an invocation uttered in
his hour of anguish by Philoctetes to Death, the deliverer:</p>

<p>The fragments of Sophocles are, perhaps, in even a stricter sense
than those of &AElig;schylus, a bare anthology, and the best way of
dealing with them is to select those which illustrate the beauty
of his style or the ripeness of his wisdom. Few, indeed, are full
enough to afford materials for reconstructing the plot of a lost
play. What, for instance, can be more tantalizing to the student
of Greek manners and sentiments than to know that Sophocles
wrote a drama with the title <i>Lovers of Achilles</i>, and yet to have
no means of judging of its fable better than is given in this pretty
simile?</p>

<p>A whole series of plays were written by Sophocles on the tale of
Helen, and all of them have passed, "like shapes of clouds we
form, to nothing." There was, again, a drama of the <i>Epigoni</i>,
which might, perhaps, have carried the tale of Thebes still further
than the climax reached in the <i>Antigone</i>. Yet Stob&aelig;us has only
thought fit to treat us to two excerpts from it, whereof the following,
spoken by Alcm&aelig;on to Eriphyle, is the fullest:</p>

<p>The sententious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> philosophy of life that endeared Euripides to the
compilers of commonplace-books was expressed by Sophocles also,
with sufficient independence of the context to make his speeches
valuable as quarries for quotation. To this accident of his art is
probably due the large number of fragments we possess upon
general topics of morality and conduct. In the following fine
passage the poet discusses the apparent injustice in the apportionment
of good and evil fortune to virtuous and vicious men:</p>

<p>Whenever we compare Euripides with his predecessors, we are
led to remark that he disintegrated the drama by destroying its
artistic unity and revealing the <i>modus operandi</i> of the scientific
analyst. All the elements of a great poem were given as it were
in their totality by &AElig;schylus. Sophocles, while conscious of the
effect to be gained by resolving the drama into its component
parts, was careful to recombine them by his art. It is difficult
with either &AElig;schylus or Sophocles to separate a passage from its
context without injuring the whole, or to understand the drift of
a sentence without considering both circumstance and person.
With Euripides the case is somewhat different. Though he composed
dramas supremely good in the aggregate impression left
upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> our mind, we feel that he employed his genius with delight
in perfecting each separate part regarded by itself alone. So
much of time and talent might be spent on the elaboration of the
plot, so much on the accentuation of the characters, so much on
lyric poetry, so much on moral maxims, so much on description,
and so much on artificial argument. There is something over-strained
in this crude statement; yet it serves to indicate the
analytic method noticeable in Euripides. It consequently happened
that his plays lent themselves admirably to the scissors and
paste-box method of the compilers. He was a master of gnomes
and sentences, and his tragedies were ready-made repertories of
quotations. The good cause and the better were pleaded in his
dialogues with impartial skill, because it was the poet's aim to set
forth what might be said rhetorically&mdash;because he took a lively
interest in casuistry for its own sake. These qualities, combined
with so much that is attractive in his fables, radiant in his fancy,
tender in his human sympathy, and romantic in his conduct of a
play, endeared him to the Greeks of all succeeding ages. What
they wanted in dramatic poetry he supplied better than any other
playwright, except perhaps Menander, who, for similar reasons,
shared a similar exceptionally lucky fate. The result is that,
besides possessing at least eighteen of the plays of Euripides, as
against seven of Sophocles and seven of &AElig;schylus, our anthology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of Euripidean excerpts is voluminous in the same ratio. The majority
of these we owe to the industry of Stob&aelig;us, who always
found something to his purpose in a drama of Euripides, while
collecting wise precepts and descriptive passages to illustrate the
nature of a vice or virtue. We must be careful, amid the medley
of sentiments expressed with equal force and equal ease, to remember
that they are not the poet's own, but put into the mouth
of his dramatic personages. What is peculiar is the impartiality
of rhetorical treatment they display&mdash;a quality which, though it
may not justify, accounts for, the Aristophanic hostility to the
Euripidean school of talkers on all subjects.</p>

<p>In addition to fragments, there remain detached portions of
the <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, the <i>Erechtheus</i>, and the <i>Antiope</i>, sufficient, if nothing
else had been preserved of the Euripidean drama, to suggest
a better notion of this poet and his style than of Ion or Ach&aelig;us,
his lost compeers in the Alexandrian Canon. From the catastrophe
of the <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, for example, it appears that Euripides contrived
a truly striking contrast between the reception of the dead
youth's corpse into the palace by his mother, and the advent, immediately
following, of his father with a Chorus chanting bridal
hymns. Lycurgus the orator, quoting the <i>Erechtheus</i>, has transmitted
a characteristic speech by Praxithea, who deserves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
added to the list of courageous women painted with the virtues
of &#949;&#8016;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945; by Euripides. She maintains that, just as she would
gladly send forth sons in the face of death to fight for their country,
so, when the State requires of her the sacrifice of a daughter,
she would be ashamed to refuse this much and far more. The
outlines of the <i>Antiope</i> are more blurred; yet enough survives of
a dialectical contention between Zethus and Amphion, the one
arguing for a life of study and culture, the other for a life of
arms and action, to illustrate this phase of the master's manner.
With regard to the <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, it should be mentioned that Goethe
attempted its restitution. His essay may be studied with interest
by those who seek to understand the German poet's method
of approaching the antique. The reverence with which he handles
the precious relics may possibly astonish scholars, who, through
fastidiousness of taste, have depreciated a dramatist they imperfectly
comprehend.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> English literature, since the beginning of
this year, can boast its own <i>Erechtheus</i>, restored by Swinburne on
the model of &AElig;schylus rather than Euripides. While referring
to the mutilated dramas of Euripides, the opening to the <i>Dana&euml;</i>
requires a passing word of comment. It consists of a prologue
in the mouth of Hermes, a chorus, and a couple of lines spoken
by Acrisius. The whole, however, is pretty clearly the work of
some medi&aelig;val forger, and has, so far a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>s it goes, the same kind
of interest as the &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#8049;&#963;&#967;&#969;&#957;, because it illustrates the ascendency
of Euripides during the later ages of Greek culture.</p>

<p>Irksome as it may be to both writer and reader, I know no better
method of dealing with the fragments of Euripides than that
already adopted with regard to those of Sophocles. The fragments
themselves are precious, and deserve to be presented to the
modern student with loving and reverential care. Yet there is no
way of centralizing the interest of their miscellaneous topics; and
to treat them as an anthology of quotations, selecting the most
characteristic and translating these as far as possible into equivalent
lines, is all that I can do.</p>

<p>A peculiarly interesting fragment in its bearing on Greek life
shall be chosen for the first quotation. It comes from the satyric
drama of <i>Autolycus</i>, and expresses the contempt felt by cultivated
Athenians for young men who devoted all their energies to gymnastics.
It is not easy to connect the idea of vulgarity with that
of the Greek athletes whose portraits in marble, no less resplendent
than the immortal Apoxyomenos of the Vatican, adorned
the peristyles of Altis. Yet there can be little doubt from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>following fragment, taken in connection with certain hints in
Plato, that these muscular heroes of an hour, for whom wreaths
were woven and breaches broken in the city walls, struck some
green-eyed philosophers as the incarnation of rowdyism. Euripides,
if we may trust his biographers, had been educated by his
father as an athlete; and it is not improbable that his early distaste
for an eminently uncongenial occupation, no less than his
familiarity with the manners of its professors, embittered his style
in this sarcastic passage. Such splendid beings as the Autolycus,
before whom the distinguished guests in Xenophon's Symposium
were silenced, seemed to our poet at best but sculptor's models,
walking statues, &#960;&#8057;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#955;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, and at worst mere slaves of
jaws and belly, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8051;&#962;. Early in Greek literature the
same relentless light of moral science, like the gaze of Apollonius
undoing Lamia's charm, had been cast upon the athletes by Xenophanes
of Colophon. While listening to Euripides, we can
fancy that the Adikos Logos from the <i>Clouds</i> of Aristophanes is
speaking through his lips to an Athenian audience, composed of
would-be orators and assiduous dikasts:</p>

<p>Passing from the athletes to a cognate subject, the following
fragment from the <i>Dictys</i> nobly expresses the ideal of friendship.
The first two lines seem to need correction; I have let them
stand, though inclined to propose &#954;&#949;&#7984; for &#954;&#945;&#8054;, and to conjecture
the loss of a line after the second:</p>

<p>About Eros and Aphrodite the poet has supplied us with a
good store of contradictory sentiments. In one long and very
remarkable fragment (No. 839, ed. Dindorf) from an unknown
play, Euripides, if he be indeed the author of the verses, has imitated
&AElig;schylus, taking almost word for word the famous vaunt
of Kupris, quoted above from the <i>Danaides</i>. The three next
pieces may be also cited among the praises of Love:</p>

certainly abused them in stronger terms. The following is an

<p>For the sanctities of domestic life, and for the pathetic beauty
of maternal love, no poet had a deeper sense than Euripides. The
following lines, spoken apparently by Dana&euml;, makes us keenly regret
the loss of the tragedy that bore her name; all the tenderness
of the Simonidean elegy upon her fable seems to inspire the
maiden's longing for a child to fill her arms and sport upon her
knee:</p>

<p>The sentiment here expressed seems to be contradicted by a
fragment from an unknown play (No. 887), where a son tells his
mother that he cannot be expected to cling to her as much as to
his father. The Greeks, as we gather from the <i>Oresteia</i> of &AElig;schylus,
believed that the male offspring was specially related by sympathy,
duty, and hereditary qualities to his father. The contrast
between women and men in respect to the paternal home is well
conveyed in the following four lines:</p>

<p>Further to illustrate his conception of true nobility, using for
this purpose in particular the fragments of the <i>Antiope</i>, would be
easy. It appears throughout that Euripides was bent on contrasting
the honor that is won by labor with the pleasures of a
lazy life. Against the hedonism which lay so near at hand to
pagans in the license of the flesh, the Greeks set up an ideal of
glory attainable alone by toil. This morality found expression in
the famous lines of Hesiod on &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8053;, in the action of Achilles, in
the proverb &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8048; &#967;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#960;&#8049;, and in the fable of the choice
of Hercules. Euripides varies the theme in his iambics by a
hundred modulations:</p>

<p>In the foregoing specimens no selection has been made of lines
remarkable for their &aelig;sthetic beauty. This omission is due to
Stob&aelig;us, who was more bent on extracting moral maxims than
strains of poetry comparable with the invocation of Hippolytus
to Artemis. Two, however, I have marked for translation on
account of their artistic charm; the first for its pretty touch of
picturesqueness, the second for its sympathy with sculpture:</p>

<p>One single line, noticeable for its weighty meaning, and Euripidean
by reason of its pathos, shall end the list:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#957;&#8051;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#948;&#8051; &#947;' &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#947;&#8059;&#956;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#966;&#961;&#8051;&#957;&#945;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lasting title to fame of Euripides consists in his having
dealt with the deeper problems of life in a spirit which became
permanent among the Greeks, so that his poems, like those of
Menander, never lost their value as expressions of current philosophy.
Nothing strikes the student of later Greek literature more
strongly than this prolongation of the Euripidean tone of thought
and feeling. In the decline of tragic poetry the literary sceptre
was transferred to comedy, and the comic playwrights may be
described as the true successors of Euripides. The dialectic
method, degenerating into sophistic quibbling, which he affected,
was indeed dropped, and a more harmonious form of art than
the Euripidean was created for comedy by Menander, when the
Athenians, after passing through their disputatious period, had
settled down into a tranquil acceptation of the facts of life. Yet
this return to harmony of form and purity of perception did not
abate the influence of Euripides. Here and there throughout his
tragedies he had said once and for all, and well said, what the
Greeks were bound to think and feel upon important matters,
and his sensitive, susceptible temperament repeated itself over and
over again among his literary successors. The exclamation of
Philemon that, if he could believe in immortality, he would hang
himself to see Euripides, is characteristic not only of Philemon,
but also of the whole Macedonian period of Greek literature.</p>

<p>Among the losses in Greek literature few are so tantalizing as
the almost absolute extinction of the tragic poets who preceded
and followed the supreme Athenian triumvirate. It would have
been exceedingly interesting to trace the history of the drama
from its rude origins up to the point at which the creative <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>genius
of &AElig;schylus gave it an inalienable character, and again to note
the deviation of the tragic muse from heroic themes to fables of
pure fiction under the influence of Agathon. This pleasant task
of analytical criticism, concordant with the spirit of our age,
which is not satisfied with admiring masterpieces unless it can
also understand the law of their growth and mark the several
stages in the process of historical development, will fall to the lot
of no student now, unless, indeed, Pompeii render up a treasure-house
of MSS. as yet undreamed of, and Signor Fiorelli save the
priceless leaflets of charred tinder from destruction.</p>

<p>Why is it that out of the seventy plays of &AElig;schylus only seven
are extant; of the Sophoclean one hundred and thirteen (allowing
seventeen others which bore his name to have been spurious)
only seven; while eighteen&mdash;or, if we admit the <i>Rhesus</i>, nineteen&mdash;are
the meagre salvage from the wreck of at least seventy-five
dramas by Euripides? Why is it that of their lost tragedies we
possess but inconsiderable fragments&mdash;just enough to prove that
the compilers of commonplace books like Stob&aelig;us might, if they
had pleased, have gratified our curiosity beyond the dreams of a
Renaissance scholar's covetousness? Why, again, is it that of
Agathon, whose dramatic romance, the <i>Flower</i>, was thought worthy
of citation by Aristotle, whom Aristophanes named as &#7944;&#947;&#8049;&#952;&#969;&#957; &#8001;
&#954;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#962;, &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8052;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962;,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> whose thanksgiving
banquet supplied a frame for Plato's dialogue on Love, and
whose style, if faithfully depicted by the philosopher, was a very
"rivulet of olive-oil noiselessly running"&mdash;why is it that of this
Agathon we know nothing but what may be inferred from the
caricature of the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>, the portrait of the <i>Symposium</i>,
and a few critical strictures in the <i>Poetics</i>? Why is it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>Ion, who enjoyed a great renown (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8057;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;) and ranked
as fifth in the muster-roll of Athenian tragic poets, is now but a
mere empty name? To these questions, which might be rhetorically
multiplied <i>ad infinitum</i> on a hundred tones of querulous
and sad expostulation with the past, there is no satisfactory answer.
Not, as Bacon asserted, has time borne down upon his
flood the froth and trash of things; far rather may we thank fate
that the flotsam and the jetsam that have reached our shore include
the best works of antiquity. Yet, notwithstanding this,
"the iniquity of oblivion," in the words of Sir Thomas Browne,
"blindly scattereth her poppy, and deals with the memory of
men without distinction to merit of perpetuity."</p>

<p>The students of antiquity attached less value than we do to
literature of secondary importance. It was the object of their
criticism, especially in the schools of Alexandria, to establish
canons of perfection in style. The few great authors who were
deemed worthy to rank as standards received unlimited honor,
nor was it thought too much by Aristarchus or Aristophanes to
devote a lifetime to their service. For inferior poets, whom we
should prize as necessary to a full comprehension of the history
of art, they felt less respect, not having grasped the notion that
&aelig;sthetics are a branch of science, that the topmost peaks of Parnassus
tower above the plain by gradual ascent from subordinate
mountain-ranges, and that those who seek to scale the final altitudes
must tread the intermediate heights. They were contented
with representative men. Marlowe, according to their laws of
taste, would have been obscured by Shakespeare; while the multitude
of lesser playwrights, whom we honor as explaining and
relieving by their comradeship the grandeur of <i>the</i> dramatist (&#8001;
&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8179;&#948;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#962; they might have styled Shakespeare, as their Pindar
was &#8001; &#955;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#962;), would have sunk into oblivion, leaving him alone
in splendid isolation. Much might be said for this way of dealing
with literature. By concentrating attention on undeniab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>le
excellence, a taste for the noblest things in art was fostered, while
the danger that we run of substituting the historical for the
&aelig;sthetic method was avoided.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In our own century Auguste</p>

<p>Comte has striven to revive the cultus of unique standards and
to re-establish the empire of selective canons.</p>

<p>The scholiasts of Alexandria, working in vast libraries which
contained the whole treasures of Greek literature, decided that
only a few poets were worthy of minute study. The works of
these few poets, again, they classified into masterpieces and inferior
productions. A further selection sifted those that seemed
best suited for the education of youth. Thus it happened that
copies were repeated of certain well-established favorites; and so
the treasures of dramatic poetry inherited by us represent the
taste of scholiasts and teachers rather than the likings of the Attic
audience. To judge by references in the plays of Aristophanes,
the lost <i>Myrmidones</i> of &AElig;schylus, the lost <i>Andromeda</i> of
Euripides, enjoyed more popularity at Athens than even the <i>Agamemnon</i>
or the <i>Medea</i>. Alexandrian and Byzantine pedagogues
thought otherwise, and posterity was bound to be their pensioner.
The difficulty of multiplying codices must be added as a most
important cause of literary waste. It is doubtful whether we
should now possess more than a few plays of Shakespeare and
Jonson out of the whole voluminous Elizabethan literature, but
for the accident of printing. When we consider the circumstances
under which the Attic dramatists survived, taking into
account the famous fraud whereby Ptolemy Euergetes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> possessed
himself of the MS. of &AElig;schylus,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and remembering the vicissitudes
successively of Alexandria, of Rome, and of Byzantium, perhaps
we ought to be surprised that the sum total of our inheritance
is so great. What the public voice of the Athenians had
approved, the scholiasts of Alexandria winnowed. What the
Alexandrians selected found its way to Rome. What the Roman
grammarians sanctioned was carried in the dotage of culture
to Byzantium. At each transition the peril by land and sea to
rare codices, sometimes probably to unique autographs, was incalculable.
Then followed the fury of iconoclasts and fanatics, the
firebrands of Omar, the remorseless crusade of Churchmen against
paganism, and the three great conflagrations of Byzantium. It
is humiliating to the nations of Western Europe to compare the
wealth of Greek books enjoyed by Photius in the ninth century,
even after the second burning, with the meagre fragments which
seem to have survived the pillage of Constantinople by the Crusaders
in 1204. To this final disaster we ought probably to assign
the destruction of the larger portion of Greek literature. In
addition to all the ruin wrought by fire and pillage must be reckoned
the slow decay of learning during the centuries of intellectual
apathy that preceded the fall of the Eastern Empire. What
the fire and the Frank had spared was still exposed to the tooth
of the worm and to the slow corrosion of dust, damp, and mildew.</p>

<p>When the passion for antiquity was rekindled in the fourteenth
century by the Italians, they eagerly demanded from Constantinople
the treasures that the capital of Greece contained; nor is
there any good reason to suppose that the Turkish troops o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>f Mahomet
II., in 1453, destroyed many books that had not previously
been transferred in copies to Florence and Venice. During at
least a quarter of a century before the downfall of the Byzantine
Empire the princes of Italy were eagerly competing with each
other for the purchase of Greek manuscripts; and throughout
this period it was the immediate interest of the pal&aelig;ologi to lay
them under such obligations as might enlist their sympathy and
call forth a return of friendly service. For the emperor to have
closed the doors of the Byzantine libraries against the agents of
the Medici and the Venetian nobles, at the same time that he was
sending Manuel Chrysoloras as an ambassador for aid against the
Turks to Western Europe, would have been ridiculous. We must
also bear in mind how many eager Italian scholars, supported by
exhibitions from the lords of Florence, and supplied with almost
unlimited credit for the purchase of literary treasures, pursued
their studies at Constantinople, and returned, like bees, book-laden
with the honey of old learning, home; how many Levant
merchants, passing to and fro between Italian and Greek ports,
discovered that parchments were a more profitable freight than
gems or spices. Taking all this into consideration, and duly
weighing Curzon's competent opinion&mdash;"so thoroughly were
these ancient libraries" (of Athos) "explored in the fifteenth
century that no unknown classic author has been discovered, nor
has any MS. been found of greater antiquity than some already
known in the British Museum and other libraries"&mdash;we have the
right to infer that what the printing-press of Aldus made imperishable,
was all, or nearly all, that the degenerate scholars of the
later age of Hellas cared to treasure. The comparative preservation
of Neoplatonic philosophy, for example, when contrasted with
the loss of dramatic literature may be ref<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>erred to the theological
and mystical interests of Byzantine students. Only one codex of
first-rate importance is supposed to have perished in Italy after
importation from Byzantium and before the age of printing.
That was a MS. of Menander, which Vespasiano, the Florentine
bookseller, mentioned among the gems of the library of Urbino.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Little, however, was known about the Greek dramatic poets at the
time when Vespasiano wrote his Lives, and it is not impossible
that what he took for a collection of Menander's plays, was really
a commonplace book of such fragments as we still possess. Yet
the mere mention of this volume raises curious speculation. We
know that when Cesare Borgia possessed himself of Urbino in
1502 he carried off from the ducal palace a booty in jewels, plate,
furniture, and books to the value of 150,000 ducats. Some of
the MSS. found their way into the Vatican collection; others
were restored to Urbino, whence they were again transferred to
Rome after the extinction of the ducal family in the seventeenth
century. It is conceivable that the Menander, if it existed, may
have been lost in the hurry of forced marches and the confusion
that involved the Borgia's career. Had it been stolen, the thief
could hardly have offered it for sale in its splendid dress of crimson
velvet and silver clasps stamped with the arms of Montefeltro.
It may even now be lurking somewhere in obscurity&mdash;a treasure
of more value than the Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>Putting aside the fragments of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
it may be broadly stated that what survives of the other
tragic poets of the Attic stage, and what we know about their
lives, have been derived in the main from four sources. The
plays of Aristophanes and the fragments of the later comic poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>s,
who were the merciless critics of contemporary tragedians,
have, in the first place, supplied us with some meagre quotations
and with numerous insignificant caricatures. From these questionable
authorities we learn, for instance, that Agathon was a
man of effeminate manners, that Philocles was horribly ugly, that
Morsimus was an indifferent eye-doctor as well as a writer of tame
tragedies, that Meletus had no inspiration, that the whole family
of Carkinus were barbarians, that Pythangelus and Akestor were
no better than slaves, that Gnesippus mismanaged his Choruses,
that Hieronymus delighted in horrors, that Nothippus and Morychus
were gluttons, that Moschion was a parasite, and so forth.
To attach very much weight to comic squibs which dwell exclusively
upon personal defects and foibles, and repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>
the stock Athenian calumnies of drunkenness and debauchery,
would be uncritical; though it must be borne in mind that satire
in a Greek city, where all the eminent burghers were well known
to the play-goers, was pointless unless it contained a grain of
truth. Our second great authority is Athen&aelig;us, a man of wide
reading and extensive curiosity, whose heart unhappily was set on
trifles. Sauces, unguents, wreaths, the various ways of dressing
fish, the changes of fashion in wine-drinking, formed the subjects
of his profoundest investigations. Therefore the grave and
heightened tragedies of our unfortunate poets were ransacked by
him for rare citations, capable of throwing light upon a flower, a
dish, or a wine-cup. These matters were undoubtedly the veriest
<i>parerga</i> to poets bent on moving the passions of terror and pity;
nor can we imagine a more distressing torment for their souls in
Hades than to know that what remains of a much-pondered and
belo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>ved <i>Thyestes</i> is a couple of lines about a carving-knife or
meat-dish. To be known to posterity through a calumny of
Aristophanes and a citation in the <i>Deipnosophist&aelig;</i>, after having
passed a long life in composing tragedies, teaching choruses, and
inventing chants, is a caricature of immortality which might well
deter a man of common-sense from literature, and induce the vainest
to go down speechless to the grave in peace. Those poets who
fell under the hands of Stob&aelig;us, our third chief source of information,
have fared better. It is more consistent with the aims and
wishes of a tragic artist to survive, however mangled, in the commonplace
book of a moralist, than in the miscellanies of a literary
<i>bon vivant</i>. The authors, therefore, of the Euripidean school,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">Teachers best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of moral prudence, with delight received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brief sententious precepts, while they treat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fate and chance and change in human life,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>may be said to have fared better than their predecessors, whose
style rendered them less conveniently subject to the eclectic process
of the Macedonian collector. Much of the difficulty, however,
which obscures the text of these sententious fragments arises from
their collector having in all probability quoted from memory, so
that bad grammar, trivial terminations to otherwise well-worded
lines, and passages ruthlessly compressed by omissions are frequent.
In the fourth place we have to thank Aristotle for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>most precious, though, alas, laconic, criticisms pronounced in the
<i>Rhetoric</i> and the <i>Poetics</i> upon his contemporaries, and for occasional
quotations in the <i>Ethics</i> to Nicomachus and Eudemus.
These criticisms help us to understand the history of the Greek
drama by throwing a dim light upon the serious art of many defunct
poets, who in their day shook the Attic scene. To Plutarch,
to Pausanias, and to the scholiasts we owe similar obligations,
though the value of their critical remarks is slight compared
with that of every word which fell from Aristotle's pen.</p>

<p>This rapid enumeration of the resources at our command will
prepare any one familiar with such matters for spare and disappointing
entertainment. The chief interest of such a survey as
that which I propose to make consists in the variety and extent
of the lost dramatic literature that it reveals. Nothing but a detailed
examination of existing fragments suffices to impress the
mind with the quantity of plays from which malignant fortune
has preserved samples, fantastically inadequate, and, in many
cases, tantalizingly uncharacteristic. The quotations from &AElig;schylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides, meanwhile, have already supplied
matter of more sterling and intrinsic value.</p>

<p>When we take up the collection of <i>Perditorum Tragicorum
Omnium Fragmenta</i>, published at Paris by the care of M. Ambroise
Firmin Didot, our first sensation, on seeking what may
possibly be left of poets before &AElig;schylus, is one of liveliest disappointment.
Thespis, to begin with, is a name: we know that
he made tragedy dramatic instead of dithyrambi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>c, by introducing
monologue in order to support and rest the Chorus; but that is
all. Ch&#339;rilus is a name: we know that he exhibited above fifty
plays, that he was reckoned worthy by the comic poet Alexis to
be cited together with Hesiod, Homer, and Epicharmus, and that
Aristotle devoted three lost books of critical discussions to the
elucidation of difficult passages in his poems as well as in those
of Archilochus and Euripides. All the rest is obscure, except
that we have reason to believe that Ch&#339;rilus excelled in the satyric
drama. Pratinas, again, is a name. Dim tradition reports
that he invented the satyric drama; and it has thence been inferred
with probability that the 150 plays ascribed to him were
chiefly composed in tetralogies of one comic and three serious
pieces. He was also celebrated for the excellence of his lyrics;
while a story, preserved by Suidas, relates how an accident that
happened to the wooden stage at Athens during the exhibition of
one of his tragedies led to the building of the recently discovered
theatre of Dionysus. A few unimportant fragments have survived,
in two of which Pratinas avows his preference for the
&AElig;olian mood in music. Phrynichus, though his poems have
fared no better than those of his contemporaries, stands before
us with a more distinguished personality. Herodotus tells the
famous tale of his tragedy upon the <i>Taking of Miletus</i>, which
moved the Athenian audience to tears, and so angered them by
the vivid presentation of a recent disaster that they fined the author
in a sum of 1000 drachmas, and forbade the acting of his
drama. The sweetness of the songs of Phrynichus has reached
us like the echo of a bird's voice in a traveller's narrative. Aristophanes,
who loved the good old music of his youth, delighted in
it, and invented one of his rare verbal conglomerates to express
its quality: &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#953;&#957;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#951; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#966;&#961;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#967;&#8053;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945; is
a phrase he puts into the mouth of Bdelycleon in the <i>Wasps</i>,
while in the <i>Frogs</i> he describes Phrynichus as making harvest in
the meadows of the Muses. Agathon, again, in the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>
is represented saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Phrynichus&mdash;this surely you have heard&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was beautiful, and beautifully dressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, we cannot doubt, was why his plays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were beautiful; for 'tis a natural law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like ourselves our work must ever be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the passage just referred to in the <i>Frogs</i> (1298-1307)
it is clear that much of a tragic poet's reputation for originality
at Athens depended upon the invention of melodies; and that
the merit of Phrynichus consisted to some extent in the excellence
and sweetness of his tunes. No real light can now be
thrown upon the dark subject of Greek music in general, and of
its relation to lyrical and tragic poetry in particular. All we
know serves to excite our inquisitiveness without satisfying it.
Thus Plutarch informs us that Phrynichus and &AElig;schylus preferred
the harp (&#954;&#8055;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#945;) and adhered to the enharmonic scale
(&#7937;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;) instead of employing chromatic modulations (&#967;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#945;).
The general drift of this remark is that the early tragic poets
maintained a simple and severe style of music, and avoided the
allurements of what Aristotle termed the most artificial of the
Greek scales. Collateral value is given to Plutarch's observation
by the Aristophanic criticism of the melodies in Agathon and
Euripides. For speculations on its deeper significance, it is impossible
to do more than refer the curious to Professor Donkin,
General Perronet Thompson, and Mr. Chappell, with the reiterated
warning that the obscurity of the subject is impenetrable.
Phrynichus, in conclusion, was celebrated as a ballet-master for
his Pyrrhic dances, and, as a practical dramatist, for the introduction
of female characters. One line, among the few ascribed to
him, calls for quotation by reason of its beauty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#955;&#8049;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953; &#948;' &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#965;&#961;&#8051;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8135;&#963;&#953; &#966;&#8182;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The light of love burns upon crimson cheeks.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Aristias, the next in order of these lost poets, was a son of Pratinas,
who lived long enough to compete with Sophocles. The
names of his plays, <i>Ant&aelig;us</i>, <i>Atalanta</i>, <i>Cyclops</i>, <i>Orpheus</i>, and <i>The
Fates</i>, show, like similar lists which might be quoted from the meagre
notices of his predecessors, that the whole material of Greek
mythology was handled and rehandled by the Attic playwrights.</p>

<p>The tragedians who follow can certainly not be considered older
than &AElig;schylus, and are, all of them, most probably his juniors.
Aristarchus, a native of Tegea, calls for notice because he
is reported by Suidas to have determined the length of tragedies,
whatever that may mean. Ennius translated his drama of <i>Achilles</i>
into Latin, which proves that he retained the fame of a first-rate
poet till the beginning of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman period. His
fragments recall the Euripidean style; and the two best of them
have been preserved by Stob&aelig;us, the notorious admirer of Euripides.
To omit these, in the dearth of similar heirlooms from antiquity,
would be wasteful, especially as they serve to determine
the date at which he wrote, and to confirm the report of Suidas
that he was a contemporary of Euripides. Here is one that savors
strongly of agnosticism:</p>

<p>Next to Aristarchus of Tegea we find Neophron of Sikyon, who
claims particular attention as the author of a tragedy acknowledged
by antiquity to have been the original of the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides.
There are few students of literature who do not recognize
in the <i>Medea</i> the masterpiece of that poet, and who have not
wondered why it only won the third prize at Athens, in the year
431 B.C. Is it possible that because Euripides borrowed his play
from Neophron&mdash;&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#961;&#8118;&#956;&#945; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#925;&#949;&#8057;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#8049;&#963;&#945;&#962;
are the words of the Greek argument to <i>Medea</i>, while
Suidas says of Neophron &#959;&#8023; &#966;&#8049;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#917;&#8016;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8055;&#948;&#959;&#965; &#924;&#8053;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;&mdash;therefore
the public and the judges thought some deduction
should be made from the merit of the drama?</p>

<p>Stob&aelig;us has handed down a long and precious fragment from
the speech in which Neophron's Medea decides to kill her children.
A comparison of this fragment with the splendid rhesis
composed for Medea by Euripides proves the obligation owed by
the younger poet to the elder, both in style and matter.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the monologue of Neophron's Medea:</p>

<p>It is hardly possible not to recognize in these lines the first
sketch of the picture afterwards worked out so elaborately in detail
by Euripides.</p>

<p>Ion was a native of Chios, who came while still a boy (&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8049;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#953;
&#956;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8049;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;) to Athens, and enjoyed the honor of supping with
Cimon in the house of a certain Laomedon. Of his life and work
very little is known, although his reputation among the ancients
was so great that the Alexandrians placed him among the first
five tragic poets. The titles of eleven of his plays have been preserved;
but these were only a few out of many that he wrote.
He was, besides, a voluminous prose-author, and practised every
kind of lyrical poetry. From the criticism of Longinus we gather
that his dramas were distinguished for fluency and finish rather
than for boldness of conception or sublimity of style. After
praising their regularity, Longinus adds that he would not exchange
the <i>&#338;dipus</i> of Sophocles for all the tragedies of Ion put
together. Personally, Ion had the reputation of a voluptuary:
&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; are the words of Athen&aelig;us which describe
him. There is also a story that he passed some portion of
his life at Corinth in love-bondage to the beautiful Chrysilla. In
short, both as a man and an artist, Ion was true to his name and
race. It is unfortunate that the few fragments we possess of Ion's
tragedies have been transmitted for the most part by Hesychius
and Athen&aelig;us in illustration of grammatical usages and convivial
customs. The following gnomic couplet, preserved by Plutarch,
is both interesting in itself and characteristic of the poet's style:</p>

<p>Almost less can be said about Ach&aelig;us of Eretria, the fifth, with
&AElig;schylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Ion, in the Alexandrian &#960;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951;
&#964;&#8049;&#958;&#953;&#962;, or first class of tragic worthies. Diogenes Laertius records
his skill in the satyric drama; Athen&aelig;us remarks that his style
was obscure, and that he filled his plays with riddles. The names
of some of his dramas&mdash;<i>Linus</i>, <i>The Fates</i>, <i>Philoctetes at Troy</i>, <i>Omphale</i>,
<i>Peirithous</i>&mdash;excite our curiosity; but the fragments are, as
usual, cited for some merely frivolous or pedantic purpose.</p>

<p>In this portrait we recognize the young men satirically described
by Euripides in a fragment, translated above, of the lost
<i>Autolycus</i>, as roaming about the city in the radiant insolence of
youth, like animated statues.</p>

<p>Mourn as we may the loss of Ion and Ach&aelig;us, our grief for
that of Agathon must needs be greater. Though he was not
placed in the first class by the Alexandrian critics, it is clear from
the notices of Plato, Aristophanes, and Aristot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>le that he enjoyed
the widest popularity at Athens, and was, besides, a poet of
marked originality. Personally, he was amiable, delicate, pleasure-loving,
and extremely beautiful. He is always called&mdash;even
by Plutarch and Athen&aelig;us&mdash;&#7944;&#947;&#8049;&#952;&#969;&#957; &#8001; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8057;&#962;, Agathon the beautiful;
while the passionate friendship with which he had inspired
Pausanias is celebrated by Plato in <i>Protagoras</i>, by Xenophon in
the <i>Symposium</i>. Later authors, like Maximus Tyrius, gave him
the title of &#7937;&#946;&#961;&#8057;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, while Lucian compared him to Cinyras or
Sardanapalus. Apparently he was rich enough to indulge the
most luxurious tastes. One of the best comic scenes in the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>
is that in which Aristophanes described Agathon
surrounded by all the appliances of a voluptuary, while engaged
in the composition of an effeminate play. Euripides, entering
this study of a Sybarite, implores him to put on female attire,
using these arguments:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#963;&#8058; &#948;' &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8057;&#962;, &#7952;&#958;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#7937;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#8057;&#962;, &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#8052;&#962; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In poetry Agathon adopted innovations consistent with his own
voluptuous temperament. His style was distinguished by melodious
sweetness and rhetorical refinements; in particular, we are
told that he affected the flowery tropes and the antitheses of Gorgias.
Sophistry was fashionable in his youth, and Aristophanes
recognized in Agathon the true companion of Euripides.
Leaving the severer music of the elder tragedians, he invented
chromatic melodies, which seem to have tickled the sensuality of
his Athenian a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>udience.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>We are therefore justified in regarding Agathon as the creator
of a new tragic style combining the verbal elegances and ethical
niceties of the sophists with artistic charms of a luxurious kind.
Aristotle observes that he separated the Chorus from the action
of the drama to such an extent that his lyrics became mere musical
interludes &#7952;&#956;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#953;&#956;&#945;, equally adapted to any tragic fable.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
He also remarks that Agathon composed plays upon romantic
subjects, inventing the story for himself, instead of adhering to
the old usage of rehandling mythological material.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The title of
one of these dramatic romances, <i>The Flower</i>, has been preserved;
but unhappily we are told nothing about its subject, and have no
extracts to judge from. That the form of tragedy suffered other
changes at the hands of Agathon may be inferred from another
passage in the <i>Poetics</i>, where Aristotle censures him for having
included a whole epic, <i>The Taking of Troy</i>, in one play.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This
play, it may be said in passing, was hissed off the stage. The
popularity of Agathon may be gathered from the fact that the
first tetralogy he exhibited was crowned in 416 B.C. Plato has
chosen the supper-party which he gave in celebration of this victory
for the scene of the <i>Symposium</i>; and it is there that we
must learn to know this brilliant man of letters and of fashion in
the wittiest period of Attic social life. It is not a little curious
that the most interesting fragments of Agathon are embedded in
the <i>Ethics</i> and the <i>Rhetoric</i> of Aristotle, who must have made attentive
study of his works. While discussing the subject of free-will,
the sage of Stageira quotes this couplet:</p>

<p>Again, on the topic of art and chance, he cites:</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities to be noticed in the practice of the poetic
art among the Greeks was the formation of schools by families of
artists, in whom talent continued to be hereditary for several generations.
We observe this among the lyrists; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>but the tragedians
offer even more remarkable instances, proving how thoroughly the
most complicated of all the arts, the tragic drama&mdash;including, as
it did, the teaching of music and of dancing to Choruses, the arrangement
of stage effects, and the training of actors&mdash;was followed
as a profession at Athens. That Phrynichus founded a
school of playwrights distinguished for their musical rather than
their dramatic ability appears from the nineteenth section of the
<i>Problemata</i> of Aristotle; but we do not know whether the &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#934;&#961;&#8059;&#957;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#957; there mentioned belonged to the poet's family. It is
possible, on the other hand, to draw the pedigree of &AElig;schylus, in
which every name will represent a tragic poet. Here it is:</p>

<pre>
                  Euphorion.
                      |
        |----------------------------------|

  2. Bion.    3. Euphorion.        4. Philocles the elder.

                                    5. Morsimus.

                                    6. Astydamas the elder.
              |-----------------------------|
      7. Philocles the younger.    8. Astydamas the younger.
</pre>

<p>The &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#967;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#957;, therefore, of whom the scholiasts often
speak, numbered, together with &AElig;schylus himself, eight dramatists.
Their common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> characteristic consisted in the adherence to
the &AElig;schylean style, in the presentation of tetralogies, and in the
privilege successively enjoyed by them of bringing out old plays
of &AElig;schylus in competition with the works of younger poets.
The dramas of &AElig;schylus were in fact "a property" to his descendants.
The Athenians had publicly decreed that they might
be from year to year produced upon the scene, and Euphorion, his
son, spent his time in preparing them for exhibition. In this way
he gained four prizes, taking the first crown upon the notable occasion,
in 431 B.C., when Sophocles was second, and Euripides,
with the <i>Medea</i>, third. It appears that, as time went on, the
original compositions of &AElig;schylus suffered mutilations and alterations
at the hands of his posterity, who pretended to improve
them&mdash;after the manner of Davenant, presumably&mdash;and adapt
them to the modern taste. At last Lycurgus, about 340 B.C.,
decreed that after accurate copies had been taken of the authorized
text and deposited in the public archives, the clerk of the
city should collate them with the acted plays, and see that no deviations
from the original became established. We gather from
the comic poets that the family of &AElig;schylus also produced their
own tragedies, none of which, however, appear to have been very
excellent. Philocles the elder was laughed at by Aristophanes
partly because he was an ugly, snub-nosed, little man, with a head
like a hoopoe; partly because he introduced a comic incident into
his tragedy of <i>Pandionis</i> by exhibiting Tereus dressed out with
the feathers of a bird. The scholiasts to Aristophanes, in like
manner, inform us that Morsimus owed a certain celebrity to his
ugliness, to the tameness of his tragic style, and to his want of
skill as a professional oculist. Astydamas the elder achieved the
same sad sort of immortality through the accident of having received
the honor of a public statue before &AElig;schylus. It is lost
labor trying to form a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> conception of poets who are only
known to us in anecdotes like these.</p>

<p>Frederick Wagner, the collector of the tragic fragments, reckons
Meletus, the accuser of Socrates, and Plato, the divine philosopher,
among the school of &AElig;schylus, because it appears that
both of them composed tetralogies. From a passage in the scholiast
to Aristophanes (<i>Frogs</i>, 1302) it may be inferred that Meletus
the tragedian and Meletus the informer were one and the
same person: &#954;&#969;&#956;&#8179;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#8033;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8033;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#8057;&#960;&#959;&#957;&mdash;"he is satirized both for want of genius as a
poet and also for the badness of his moral character." This sentence
constitutes his title to fame. He is known to have composed
a series of plays with the title <i>&#338;dipodeia</i>, the plot, as
sketched by Hyginus,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> offering some notable divergences from
the Sophoclean treatment of the tale of Thebes. Plato may be
numbered among the tragedians on the strength of an anecdote
in &AElig;lian,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> according to which he had composed a tetralogy, and
had already distributed the parts to the actors, when he determined
to abandon poetry and gave his verses to the flames.</p>

<p>The school of Sophocles includes two sons of the poet, Iophon
and Ariston, and his grandson Sophocles. In fact, it combines
the actors in that family drama played out before the jury of the
tribe, when the singer of Colonus silenced his accuser by the recitation
of the Chorus from his second <i>&#338;dipus</i>. Iophon exhibited
tragedies with distinguished success during the life of Sophocles,
and even entered into competition with his father. After the
old man's death he produced the posthumous works that formed
his heirloom, completing such as were unfinished or executing
those of which the plan wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>s sketched in outline. He is said to
have exhibited fifty plays, and that he was no mean poet appears
from the following passage of the <i>Frogs</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>H.</i> Is not Iophon a good one?&mdash;He's alive, sure?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>B.</i> If he's a good one, he's our only good one;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But it's a question; I'm in doubt about him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>H.</i> There's Sophocles; he's older than Euripides&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">If you go so far for 'em, you'd best bring him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>B.</i> No; first I'll try what Iophon can do<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Without his father, Sophocles, to assist him.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The drift of these lines would be obscure without some explanation
to readers who have not studied Aristophanes. All the
good tragic poets are dead, and Dionysus is journeying to Hades
to fetch one back again to rule the Attic stage. Herakles falls
into conversation with him on the subject, and reminds him that
Iophon is living. The doubt expressed by Dionysus seems to refer
to a suspicion prevalent at Athens that Sophocles helped his
son in the composition of his plays. Meanwhile, the qualified
praise awarded him by Dionysus implies considerable admiration
on the part of so severe a castigator of the tragic dramatists as
Aristophanes. Only four and a half lines, and these by no means
noticeable, remain of Iophon. His half-brother Ariston has fared
better, since we possess a long and curious dialogue upon Providence,
quoted b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>y Theophilus of Antioch from an unknown play
of his. This fragment supports the Christian belief that, though
the careless seem to prosper, while the virtuous get no benefit
from their asceticism, justice will eventually be dealt with even
hand to all:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8054;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#7957;&#957;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is right to add that the authorship of these lines must be at
least considered doubtful, and that their versification, as it now
stands, is unworthy of the Attic drama.</p>

<p>By the middle of the fourth century before Christ the whole
dramatic literature of the Athenians, both tragic and comic, was
being penetrated with the Euripidean spirit. It is impossible not
to notice in the style of these later playwrights either the direct
influence of Euripides or else the operation of the laws of intellectual
development he illustrated. We cannot, therefore, treat
the Euripidean school with the definiteness applicable to that of
&AElig;schylus or Sophocles. At the same time it is certain that a
son or a nephew bearing his name continued to exhibit his posthumous
dramas.</p>

<p>A stronger instance of histrionic and dramatic talent transmitted
through four generations is presented by the family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Carkinus, some of whom were famous for mimetic dancing, while
others contended in the theatre as playwrights. What we know
about Carkinus and his children is chiefly derived from the satires
of Aristophanes, who was never tired of abusing them. Their
very name serves as a scarecrow, and the muse is invoked to keep
them off the stage. To stir the rubbish-heap of obscure allusions
and pedantic annotations, in order to discover which of the six
Carkinid&aelig; we know by name were poets, and which of them were
dancers, is a weary task not worth the labor it involves. Suffice
it to say that the grandson of Aristophanes's old butt, himself
called Carkinus, produced the incredible number of 160 dramas,
was three times mentioned with respect by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and has
survived in comparatively copious quotations. One passage,
though not very remarkable for poetical beauty, is interesting
because it describes the wanderings of Demeter through Sicily
in search of Persephone. Diodorus, who cites it from an unknown
play, mentions that Carkinus frequently visited Syracuse
and saw the processions in honor of Demeter.</p>

<p>About the Attic tragedians who lived during the old age of
Aristophanes, the first thing to notice is that they may fairly be
called the Epigoni of Euripides. &AElig;schylus was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> old-fashioned.
The style of Sophocles did not lend itself to easy imitation. The
psychological analyses, casuistical questions, rhetorical digressions,
and pathetic situations wherein the great poet of the <i>Hippolytus</i>
delighted were exactly suited to the intellectual tastes and temper
of incipient decadence. A nation of philosophers and rhetoricians
had arisen; and it is noteworthy that many of the playwrights
of this period were either professed orators or statesmen.
In his own lifetime Aristophanes witnessed the triumph of the
principles against which he fought incessantly with all the weapons
of the comic armory. Listen to the complaint of Dionysus
in the <i>Frogs</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>H.</i> But have not you other ingenious youths<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That are fit to out-talk Euripides ten times over&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To the amount of a thousand, at least, all writing tragedy?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>D.</i> They're good for nothing&mdash;"Warblers of the Grove"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Little, foolish, fluttering things"&mdash;poor puny wretches,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That dawdle and dangle about with the tragic muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Incapable of any serious meaning.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To translate the Greek for modern readers is not possible.
The pith of the passage is found in this emphatic phrase, &#947;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7938;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954;
&#949;&#8021;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7956;&#964;&#953;, "there's not a sound male poet capable
of procreation left." Accordingly he vents his venom on
Pythangelus, Gnesippus, Akestor, Hieronymus, Nothippus, Morychus,
Sthenelus, Dorillus, Spintharus, and Theognis, without mercy.
Not a single fragment remains to judge these wretched
poets by. It is better to leave them in their obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> than to
drag them forth into the dubious light of comic ribaldry.</p>

<p>Critias, the son of Call&aelig;schrus, the pupil of Socrates, who figures
in so many scenes of Xenophon and Plato, and who played
a memorable part in the political crisis of 404 B.C., was a tragic
poet of some talent, if we are to accept a fragment from the
<i>Sisyphus</i> as his. Sextus Empiricus transcribed forty lines of this
drama, setting forth the primitive conditions of humanity. First,
says Critias, men began by living like the brutes, without rewards
for virtue or punishment for vice. Mere might of hand prevailed.
Then laws were framed and penalties affixed to crime. Open
violence was thus repressed; but evil-doers flourished in secret.
Fraud and hypocrisy took the place of force. To invent the
dread of gods and to create a conscience was the next step taken
by humanity. Then followed the whole scheme of religion, and
with religion entered superstition, and men began to fear the
thunder and to look with strange awe on the stars. The quotation
is obviously imperfect: yet it may advantageously be compared
with the speeches of Prometheus in &AElig;schylus, and also
with the speculations of Lucretius. The hypothesis of deliberate
invention implied in the following phrases,</p>

for those modern theorists who, like Locke, imagined that la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>nguage
was produced artificially by wise men in counsel, or who,
like Rousseau and the encyclopedists, maintained that religions
were framed by knaves to intimidate fools.</p>

<p>Cleophon demands a passing notice, because we learn from
Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that he tried to reduce tragedy to the plain level of
common life by using every-day language and not attempting to
idealize his characters. The total destruction of his plays may be
regretted, since it is probable that we should have observed in
them the approximation of tragedy to comedy which ended finally
in the new comic style of the Athenians. About Cleophon's
contemporary, Nicomachus, of whom nothing is known except
that he produced a great many tragedies on the stock subjects of
mythology, nothing need be said. The case is somewhat different
with a certain Diogenes who, while writing seven tragedies
under the decorous titles of <i>Thyestes</i>, <i>Helen</i>, <i>Medea</i>, and so forth,
nevertheless contrived to offend against all the decencies of civilized
life. Later grammarians can hardly find language strong
enough to describe their improprieties. Here is a specimen:
&#7936;&#961;&#961;&#8053;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8020;&#964;&#949; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#966;&#8182; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#958;&#8055;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#969;.... &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945;
&#956;&#8050;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#961;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;, &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#8051;&#967;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;. To ascribe these impure productions to
Diogenes the Cynic, in spite of his well-known contempt for literature,
was a temptation which even the ancients, though better
informed than we are, could not wholly resist. Yet, after much
sifting of evidence, it may be fairly believed that there were two
Diogeneses&mdash;the one an Athenian, who wrote an innocuous play
called <i>Semele</i>, the other a native perhaps of Gadara, who also bore
the name of &#338;nomaus, and who perpetrated the seven indecent
parodies. Diogenes of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Sinope, meanwhile, was never among the
poets, and the plays that defended cannibalism and blasphemed
against the gods, though conceived in his spirit, belonged probably
to a later period.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Time would fail to tell of Antiphon and Polyeides, of Crates
and Python, of Nearchus and Cle&aelig;netus, of the Syracusan Ach&aelig;us
and of Dikaiogenes, of Apollodorus and Timesitheus and Patrocles
and Alkimenes and Apollonius and Hippotheon and Timocles
and Ecdorus and Serapion&mdash;of all of whom it may be briefly said
we know a few laborious nothings. Their names in a list serve
to show how the sacred serpent of Greek tragedy, when sick to
death, continued still for many generations drawing its slow
length along. Down to the very end they kept on handling
the old themes. Timesitheus, for instance, exhibited <i>Danaides</i>,
<i>Ixion</i>, <i>Memnon</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, and the like. Meanwhile a few pale
shades emerge from the nebulous darkness demanding more consideration
than the mere recording of their names implies. We
find two tyrants, to begin with, on the catalogue&mdash;Mamercus of
Catana, who helped Timoleon, and Dionysius of Syracuse. Like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Nero and Napoleon III., Dionysius was very eager to be ranked
among the authors. He spared no expense in engaging the best
rhapsodes of the day, and sent them to recite his verses at Olympia.
To deceive a Greek audience in matters of pure &aelig;sthetics
was, however, no easy matter. The men who came together attracted
by the sweet tones of the rhapsodes soon discovered the
badness of the poems and laughed them down. Some fragments
from the dramas of Dionysius have been preserved, among which
is one that proves his preaching sounder than his practice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#7969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#8054;&#962; &#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#956;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#961; &#7956;&#966;&#965;.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The intrusion of professional orators into the sphere of the
theatre might have been expected in an age when public speaking
was cultivated like a fine art, and when opportunities for the display
of verbal cleverness were eagerly sought. We are not, therefore,
surprised to find Aphareus and Theodectes, distinguished
rhetoricians of the school of Isocrates, among the tragedians. O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>f
Theodectes a sufficient number of fragments survive to establish
the general character of his style; but it is enough in this place
to notice the fusion of forensic eloquence with dramatic poetry,
against which Aristophanes had inveighed, and which was now
complete.</p>

<p>Ch&aelig;remon and Moschion are more important in the history of
the Attic drama, since both of them attempted innovations in accordance
with the literary spirit of their age, and did not, like the
rhetoricians, follow merely in the footsteps of Euripides. Ch&aelig;remon,
the author of <i>Achilles Thersitoctonos</i> and several other
pieces, was mentioned by Aristotle for having attempted to combine
a great variety of metres in a poem called <i>The Centaur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
which was, perhaps, a tragi-comedy or &#7985;&#955;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8179;&#948;&#8055;&#945;. He possessed
remarkable descriptive powers, and was reckoned by the
critics of antiquity as worthy of attentive study, though his dramas
failed in action on the stage. We may regard him, in fact,
as the first writer of plays to be read.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The metamorphoses
through which the arts have to pass in their development repeat
themselves at the most distant ages and under the most diverse
circumstances. It is, therefore, interesting to find that Ch&aelig;remon
combined with this descriptive faculty a kind of euphuism
which might place him in the same rank as Marini and Calderon,
or among the most refined of modern idyllists. He shra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>nk, apparently,
from calling things by their plain names. Water, for
example, became in his fantastic phraseology &#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;. The
flowers were "children of the spring," &#7956;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8051;&#954;&#957;&#945;&mdash;the roses,
"nurslings of the spring," &#7956;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;&mdash;the stars, "sights
of the firmament," &#945;&#7984;&#952;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8049;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;&mdash;ivy, "lover of dancers, offspring
of the year," &#967;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;&mdash;blossoms, "children
of the meadows," &#955;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8051;&#954;&#957;&#945;, and so forth. In fact,
Ch&aelig;remon rivals Gongora, Lyly, and Herrick on their own ground,
and by his numerous surviving fragments proves how impossible
it is to conclude that the Greeks of even a good age were free
from affectations. Students who may be interested in tracing
the declensions of classic style from severity and purity will do
well to read the seventeen lines preserved by Athen&aelig;us from the
tragedy of <i>&#338;neus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> They present a picture of girls playing in a
field, too artful for successful rendering into any but insufferably
ornate English.</p>

<p>The claim of Moschion on our attention is different from that
of his contemporary Ch&aelig;remon. He wrote a tragedy with the
title of <i>Themistocles</i>, wherein he appears to have handled the
same subject-matter as &AElig;schylus in the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>. The hero of
Salamis was, however, conspicuous by his absence from the history-play
of the elder poet. Lapse of time, by removing the
political difficulties under which the <i>Pers&aelig;</i> was composed, enabled
Moschion to make the great Themistocles his protagonist.
Two fragments transmitted by Stob&aelig;us from this drama, the one
celebrating Athenian liberty of speech, while the other argues
that a small band may get the better of a myriad lances, seem to
be taken from the <i>concio ad milites</i> of the hero:</p>

<p>Another tragedy of Moschion, the <i>Pher&aelig;i</i>, is interesting when
compared with the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles and the <i>Sisyphus</i> ascribed
to Critias. Its plot seems in some way to have turned
upon the duty which the living owe the dead:</p>

<p>A long quotation of thirty-four iambics, taken apparently in
like manner from the <i>Pher&aelig;i</i>, sets forth the primitive condition
of humanity. Men lived at first in caverns, like wild beasts.
They had not learned the use of iron; nor could they fashion
houses, or wall cities, or plough the fields, or garner fruits of
earth. They were cann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ibals, and preyed on one another. In
course of time, whether by the teaching of Prometheus or by
the evolution of implanted instincts, they discovered the use of
corn, and learned how to press wine from the grape. Cities arose
and dwellings were roofed in, and social customs changed from
savage to humane. From that moment it became impiety to
leave the dead unburied; but tombs were dug, and dust was
heaped upon the clay-cold limbs, in order that the old abomination
of human food might be removed from memory of men.
The whole of this passage, very brilliantly written, condenses the
speculations of Athenian philosophers upon the origin of civilization,
and brings them to the point which the poet had in view&mdash;the
inculcation of the sanctity of sepulture.</p>

<p>Nothing more remains to be said about the Attic tragedians.
At the risk of being tedious, I have striven to include the names
at least of all the poets who filled the tragic stage from its beginning
to its ending, in order that the great number of playwrights
and their variety might be appreciated. The probable date at
which Thespis began to exhibit dramas may be fixed soon after
550 B.C. Moschion may possibly have lived as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> late as 300 B.C.
These, roughly calculated, are the extreme points of time between
which the tragic art of the Athenians arose and flourished and
declined. When the Alexandrian critics attempted a general review
of dramatic literature, they formed, as we have seen already,
two classes of tragedians. In the first they numbered five Athenian
worthies. The second, called the Pleiad, included seven
poets of the Court of Alexandria; nor is there adequate reason to
suppose that this inferior canon, &#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#8049;&#958;&#953;&#962;, was formed on any
but just principles of taste. How magnificent was the revival of
art and letters, in all that pertained, at any rate, to scenic show
and pompous ritual, during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
how superbly the transplanted flowers of Greek ceremonial flourished
on the shores of ancient Nile, and how Hellenic customs
borrowed both gorgeous colors and a mystic meaning from the
contact with Egyptian rites, may be gathered from the chapters
devoted by Athen&aelig;us in the fifth book of the <i>Deipnosophist&aelig;</i> to
these matters. The Pleiad and the host of minor Alexandrian
stars have fared, however, worse than their Athenian models.
They had not even comic satirists to keep their names alive "immortally
immerded." With the exception of Lycophron, they
offer no firm ground for modern criticism. We only know that,
in this Alexandrian Renaissance, literature, as usual, repeated itself.
Alexandria, like Athens, had its royal poets, and, what is
not a little curious, Ptolemy Philopator imitated his predecessor
Dionysius to the extent of composing a tragedy, <i>Adonis</i>, with the
same title and presumably upon the same theme.</p>

Art.</p></div>


<p>In order to comprehend the differences between the ancient
and the modern drama&mdash;between the tragedy of Sophocles and
the tragedy of Shakespeare&mdash;it is necessary to enter into the details
of the history of the Attic stage. In no other department
of art is the character of the work produced so closely dependent
upon the external form which the artist h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>ad to adopt.</p>

<p>Both the tragedy and comedy of the Greeks were intimately
connected with the religious rites of Dionysus. Up to the very
last, they formed a portion of the cultus of the vintage-god, to
whom the theatre was consecrated, and at whose yearly festivals
the plays were acted. The Chorus, which originally formed the
chief portion of the dramatic body, took its station at the altar
of Bacchus in the centre of the theatre. Now the worship of
Bacchus in Greece had from the first a double aspect&mdash;joyous
and sorrowful. The joyous festivals were held in celebration of
the vigor and the force of nature, in the spring and summer of
the year; the sorrowful commemorated the sadness of the autumn
and the winter. There were, therefore, two distinct branches
of musical and choral art connected with the Dionysiac rites&mdash;the
one jovial, the other marked by the enthusiasm of a wild grief.
From the former of these, or the revel-song, sprang Comedy;
from the latter, or the dithyramb, sprang Tragedy. Arion is
named as the first great poet who cultivated the dithyramb and
wrote elaborate odes for recitation by the Chorus in their evolutions
round the Bacchic altar. His Chorus were attired like
satyrs in goat-skins, to represent the woodland comrades of the
god; hence came the name of tragedy or goat-song. At first
the dithyrambic odes celebrated only the mystical woes of Dionysus:
then they were extended so as to embrace the mythical
incidents connected with his worship; and at last the god himself
was forgotten, and the tragic sufferings of any hero were
chanted by the Chorus. This change is marked by an old tradition
concerning Sicyon, where it is said that the woes of the hero
Adrastus were sung by the Bacchic choir, and that Cleisthenes,
wishing to suppress the national mythology, restored the antique
Dionysiac function. It also may explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Greek proverb:
"What has this to do with Dionysus?"&mdash;a question which might
reasonably have been asked when the sacred representation diverged
too widely from the line of Bacchic legend.</p>

<p>Thus the original element of Greek tragedy was the dithyramb,
as cultivated by Arion; and the first step in the progress of
the dithyrambic Chorus towards the Drama was the introduction
of heroic legends into the odes. The next step was the addition
of the actor. It has been ingeniously conjectured that the actor
was borrowed from the guild of rhapsodes. The iambics of Archilochus
and other poets were recited, as we know, at the feasts
of Demeter, whose cult had points of similarity with that of Bacchus.
It is not improbable that when the heroic element was
added to the dithyramb, and the subjects handled by the professional
reciters of the Homeric and cyclic epics began to form a
part of the Dionysiac celebration, a rhapsode was then introduced
to help the Chorus in their office. That he declaimed iambics
and not hexameters may be accounted for by the prevalence of
the iambic in the sister-cult of Demeter. This, then, was the third
step in the development of tragedy. To the dithyrambic chorus
of Arion was added an interlocutor, who not only recited passages
of narrative, but also exchanged speech with the Chorus,
and who, in course of time, came to personate the hero whose history
was being celebrated. Thus far had the art advanced in the
age of Thespis. The Chorus stood and danced round the altar of
Bacchus. The rhapsode, whom we now begin to call the actor,
stood on a raised stage (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;) above them. The whole history
of Greek tragedy exhibits a regular expansion of these simple elements.
The function of the Chorus, the peculiar nature of the
masks and dresses, and the very structure of the theatres, can only
be explained by reference to thi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>s primitive constitution of the
dramatic art.</p>

<p>To Thespis the Athenian, whose first regular exhibition of the
tragic show preceded the birth of &AElig;schylus by about ten years,
belongs the credit of having brought the various elements of
tragedy into harmony, and of having fixed the outlines of the
tragic art. The destruction of Athens by the Persian army, like
the burning of London, which inflicted so severe an injury upon
our early dramatic literature, obliterated the monuments of the
genuine Thespian tragedy. Some of the names of these dramas&mdash;<i>Pentheus</i>,
<i>Phorbas</i>, <i>the Funeral Games of Pelias</i>, <i>the Priests</i>&mdash;have
been preserved; from which we may conjecture that Thespis
composed interludes with regular plots, combining choric passages
and monologues uttered by the actor with elucidatory dialogues.
His Chorus was the traditional band of mummers clad
in goat-skins&mdash;the &#964;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#959;&#953; of the ancient Dionysiac festival. The
poet himself was the actor, and his portion of the interlude was
written either in iambic or, as we may gather from a passage in
the <i>Poetics</i> of Aristotle, in trochaic metre. The next great name
after Thespis is Phrynichus, who composed a tragic interlude on
the taking of Miletus by the Persians. This fact is important,
since it proves that even at this early period a dramatist felt justified
not merely in departing from the myths of Dionysus, but
also in treating the events of contemporary history in his choric
tragedy. The Athenians, however, were indignant at so abrupt a
departure from usage, and at the un&aelig;sthetical exhibition of disasters
which had recently befallen their race. They fined the
poet, and confirmed their tragedians in the custom of handling
only ancient and religious legends. It is well known that the
single exception to this custom which has been preserved to us is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the splendid triumph of &AElig;schylus composed upon the ruin of the
godless Xerxes. Phrynichus introduced one important change
into the Thespian drama: he established female characters. After
him came Pratinas, who altered the old form of the Chorus.
Hitherto, whatever may have been the subject of the play, the
Bacchic &#964;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#959;&#953; stood in their quaint goat-skins round the thymel&eacute;,
or altar of the god. Pratinas contrived that in future the Chorus
should be attired to suit the action of the piece. If the play
were written on the fall of Troy, for instance, they appeared as
ancient Trojans; or if it had reference to the house of Laius,
they came forth as senators of Thebes. At the same time special
pieces for the traditional tragic chorus were retained, and these
received the name of satyric dramas. Henceforth it was customary
for a tragic author to produce at the same time three successive
dramas on the subject he selected, together with a satyric
play. The only essential changes which were afterwards made in
Greek tragedy were the introduction of a second actor by &AElig;schylus
and of a third actor by Sophocles, the abandonment of the
stricter rule of the tetralogy, and the gradual diminution of the
importance of the Chorus. The choric element, which had been
everything at the commencement, gave way to the dialogue, as the
art of developing dramatic situations and characters advanced;
until in the days of Euripides the Chorus formed a comparatively
insignificant part of the tragic machinery. This curtailment of
the function of the Chorus was a necessary consequence of progress
in the art of exhibiting an imitation of human action and
passion. Yet the Chorus never lost its place in Greek tragedy.
It remained to mark the origin of the drama, and as a symbol of
the essentially religious purpose of the tragic spectacle.</p>

<p>An event is said to h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ave happened during the age of Pratinas
which greatly influenced the future of the Attic drama. The
Thespian interludes had been acted on a wooden scaffolding.
This fell down on one occasion, and caused so much alarm that
the Athenians erected a permanent stone theatre, which they constructed
on the southeast side of the Acropolis. Whether this
old story is a fiction, and whether the time had not naturally arrived
for a more substantial building, may admit of question. At
any rate the new theatre was designed as though it were destined
to exist for all time, as though its architects were prescient that
the Attic drama would become the wonder of the world. The
spectators were seated on semicircular tiers scooped out of the
rock of the Acropolis. Their faces turned towards Hymettus
and the sea. The stage fronted the Acropolis; the actors had in
view the cliffs upon which stood the Parthenon and the gleaming
statue of Protective Pallas. The whole was open to the air. Remembering
these facts, we are enabled to understand the peculiar
grandeur and propriety of those addresses to the powers of the
earth and sky, to the temples of the gods, to the all-seeing sun
and glittering ocean-waves, which are so common in Greek tragedy.
The Athenian theatre was brought into close connection
with all that was most brilliant in the architecture and the sculpture
of Athens, with all that is most impressive in the natural environments
of the city, with the very deities of the Hellenic worship
in their visible manifestations to the senses of men. This
circumstance alone determined many peculiarities of the Greek
drama, which make it wholly unlike our own. If the hero of a
modern play, for instance, calls the sun to witness, he must point
to a tissue-paper transparency in the centre of a painted scene;
if he apostrophizes ocean, he must turn towards a heaving mass
of agitated canvas. But Ajax or Electra could raise their hands
to t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>he actual sun, gilding the statue of Athene with living rays;
Prometheus, when he described the myriad laughter of the dimpling
waves, knew that the sea was within sight of the audience;
and sun and sea were regarded by the nation at large, not merely
as phenomena of our universe, but as beings capable of sympathizing
with humanity in its distress. For the same reason nearly
all the scenes of the Greek tragedies are laid in daytime and in
the open air. The work of art exhibited in an unparalleled combination
of &aelig;sthetical definiteness with the actual facts of nature.
The imagination is scarcely more wrought upon than the senses;
whereas the tragedy of Shakespeare makes a direct appeal to the
inner eye and to the highly stimulated fancy of the audience.
It is generally before a temple or a palace that the action of a
Greek play proceeds. Nor was there anything artificial in this
custom; for the Greeks lived in the air of heaven, nor could
events of such magnitude as those which their tragedy represented
have been appropriately enacted beneath the shadow of a private
roof. Far different were the conditions which the modern
dramatist undertook to illustrate. The hesitations of Hamlet, the
spiritual conflict of Faustus, the domestic sufferings of the Duchess
of Malfi, are evolved with peculiar propriety within the narrow
walls of palace-chambers, college-cells, and prisons or madhouses.
Scenery, in our sense of the word, was scarcely required
by the Greeks. The name of a tragedy sufficed to determine
what palace-gate was represented by the stage: the statue of a
god was enough to show whose temple was intended. This simplicity
of theatrical arrangement led to a corresponding simplicity
of dramatic construction, to rarity of changes in the scene, and
to the stationary character of Greek tragedy in general.</p>

<p>Hollowed out of the hillside, the seats of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>the Athenian spectators
embraced rather more than a full semicircle, and this large
arc was subtended by a long straight line&mdash;the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;, or background
of the stage. In front of this wall ran a shallow platform,
not coextensive with the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;, but corresponding to the
middle portion of it. This platform was the stage proper. It
was, in fact, a development of the Thespian &#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;. The stage
was narrow and raised a little above the ground, to which a flight
of steps led from it. On the stage, very long in proportion to its
depth, all the action of the play took place: the actors entered it
through three openings in the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;, of which the central was
larger and the two side ones smaller. When they stood upon the
stage, they had not much room for grouping or for complicated
action: they moved and stood like the figures in a bass-relief,
turning their profiles to the audience, and so arranging their gestures
that a continually harmonious series of figures was relieved
upon the background of the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;. The central opening had
doors capable of being thrown back and exhibiting a chamber,
in which, at critical moments of the action, such spectacles as the
murdered body of Agamemnon, or the suicide of Jocasta, were
revealed to the spectators. The Chorus had their own allotted
station in the centre of the whole theatre&mdash;the semicircular pit
left between the lowest tier of spectators and the staircase leading
to the stage. In the middle of this pit or orchestra was
placed the thymel&eacute;, or altar of Bacchus, round which the Chorus
moved on its first entrance, and where it stood while witnessing
the action on the stage. The Chorus entered by side passages leading
from the back of the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;, on a lower level than that of the
stage; nor did they ever leave their orchestra to mount the stage
and mingle with the actors. The dressing-rooms and offices of
the theatre were concealed behind the &#963;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;. Above the stage
was suspended an aerial platform for the gods, while subterranean
stairs were constructed for the appearance of ghosts ascending
from the nether regions.</p>

<p>These details about the vast size of the theatre, its system of
construction, and its exposure to the air, make it clear that no
acting similar to that of the modern drama could have been possible
on the Attic stage. Any one who has visited the Roman
theatre of Orange, where the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053; is still in tolerable preservation,
must have felt that a classical audience could not have enjoyed
the subtle intonations of the voice and the delicate changes
in the features, expressive of varying passions, which constitute
the charm of modern acting. Our intricate and minute effects
were out of the question. Everything in the Greek theatre had
to be colossal, statuesque, almost stationary. The Greeks had so
delicate a sense of proportion and of fitness that they adjusted
their art to these necessities. The actors were raised on thick-soled
and high-heeled boots: they wore masks, and used peculiar
mouth-pieces, by means of which their voices were made more
resonant. The dresses which they swept along the stage were
the traditional costumes of the Bacchic festivals&mdash;brilliant and
trailing mantles, which added volume to their persons. All their
movements partook of the dignity befitting demigods and heroes.
To suppose that these pompous figures were of necessity ridiculous
would be a great mistake. Everything we know about Greek
art makes it certain that in the theatre, no less than in sculpture
and architecture, this nation of artists achieved a perfectly harmonious
effect. How dignified, for example, were their masks,
may be imagined from the sculptured heads of Tragedy and Comedy
preserved in the Vatican&mdash;marble fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ces of sublime serenity,
surmounted by the huge mass of curling hair, which was built up
above the mask to add height to the figure. But in order to
maintain the grandeur of these personages on the stage, it was
necessary that they should never move abruptly or struggle violently.
This is perhaps the chief reason why Greek tragedy was
so calm and so processional in character, why all its vehement action
took place off the stage, why some of its most impassioned
expressions of emotion were cadenced in elaborate lyrics with a
musical accompaniment. An actor, mounted on his buskins, and
carrying the weight of the tragic mask, could never have encountered
a similar gigantic being in personal combat without betraying
some awkwardness of movement or exhibiting some unseemly
gesture. It was, therefore, necessary to create the part of the Messenger
as an artistic correlative to the peculiarly artificial conditions
of the stage. We find in the same circumstance a reason
why the tragic situation was sustained with such intensity, why
the action was limited to a short space of time and to a single locality,
and why few changes were permitted in the characters during
the conduct of the same piece. For the mask depicted one
fixed cast of features; and though, as in the case of &#338;dipus, who
tears out his eyes in a play of Sophocles, the actor might appear
twice upon the stage with different masks, yet he could not be
constantly changing them. Therefore the strong point of the
Greek dramatist lay in the construction of such plots and characters
as admitted of sustained and steady passion, whereas a modern
playwright aims at providing parts which shall enable a great
actor to exhibit lights and shades of varying expression. It still
remains a problem how such parts as the Cassandra of &AElig;schylus
and the Orestes of Euripides could have been adequately acted
with a mask to hide the features; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>but such effects as those for
which Garrick, Rachel, and Talma were celebrated would have
been utterly impossible at Athens.</p>

<p>In attempting to form any conception of a Greek drama, we
must imbue our minds with the spirit of Greek sculpture, and animate
some frieze or bass-relief, supplying the accompaniment of
simple and magnificent music, like that of Gluck, or like the recitatives
of Porpora. Flaxman's designs for &AElig;schylus are probably
the best possible reconstruction of the scenes of a Greek tragedy,
as they appeared to the eyes of the spectators, relieved upon the
background of the &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8053;. Schlegel is justly indignant with those
critics who affirm that the modern opera affords an exact parallel
to the Greek drama. Yet the combination of music, acting, scenery,
and dancing in such an opera as Gluck's <i>Orfeo</i> or Cherubini's
<i>Medea</i> may come nearer than anything else towards giving us a
notion of one of the tragedies of Euripides. This remark must
be qualified by the acknowledgment of a radical and fundamental
difference between the two species of dramatic art. Music, dancing,
acting, and scenery, with the Greeks, were sculptural, studied,
stately; with the moderns they are picturesque, passionate,
mobile. If the opera at all resembles the Greek drama, it is because
of the highly artificial development of the histrionic art
which it exhibits. The expression of passion in a stationary and
prolonged aria, with which we are familiar in the opera, and which
is far removed from nature, was of common occurrence in Greek
tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>So far we have been occupied with those characteristics of the
ancient drama which were immediately determined by the external
circumstances of the Attic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>stage. I have tried to show that
some of the most marked qualities of the work of art were necessitated
by the conditions of its form. But other and not less important
points of difference between the ancient and the modern
drama were due to the subject-matter of the former. The Greek
playwrights confined themselves to a comparatively narrow circle
of mythical stories;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> each in succession had recourse to Homer
and to the poets of the epic cycle. &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, not to mention their numerous forgotten rivals, handled
and rehandled the same themes. We have, for example, extant
three tragedies, the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> of &AElig;schylus, the <i>Electra</i> of
Sophocles, and the <i>Electra</i> of Euripides, composed upon precisely
the same incident in the tale of Agamemnon's children. Modern
dramatists, on the contrary, start with the whole stuff of human
history; they seek out their subjects where they choose, or invent
motives with a view to the exhibition of varied character, force
of passion, tragic effect; nor have they any fixed basis of solid
thought like the doctrine of Nemesis<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> whereon to rear their tragic
superstructure. In this respect the mystery-plays of the Catholic
Church offer a close parallel to the Greek drama. In these
dramatic shows the whole body of Christian tradition&mdash;the Bible,
the acts of the saints, and the doctrines of the Church about the
Judgment and the final state of the soul&mdash;was used as the material
from which to fashion sacred plays. But between the mysteries
and the early Attic tragedies there was one great point of
difference. The sanctity of the Christian tradition, by giving an
immovable form to the legends, precluded all freedom of the fancy.
There could be no inventive action of the poet's mind when
he was engaged in setting forth the mysteries of the Incarnation,
the Atonement, or the final Judgment. His object was to instruct
the people in certain doctrines, and all he could do was to repeat
over and over again the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> series of events in which God had
dealt with man. Therefore, when the true dramatic instinct
awoke in modern Europe, the playwrights had to quit this narrow
sphere of consecrated thoughts. Miracle-plays were succeeded
by moralities, by histories, and by those unfettered creations
of which Marlowe in England offered the first illustrious examples.
Had the Thespian interludes been as purely didactic in
their object as the early mystery-plays of the Church, we should
either have possessed no Attic drama at all or else have received
from the Greek poets a very different type of tragedy. As it
was, the very essence of Greek religion reached its culminating
point in art. Epical mythology attained to final development in
the free artistic creations of Sophocles. Meanwhile the dramatists
were hampered in their choice of subjects by the artificial restraints
imposed upon them. They were never at liberty to invent. They
were always bound to keep in view the traditional interpretation
of legends to which a semi-religious importance attached.</p>

<p>Many distinctions between the ancient and the modern drama
may be deduced from this original difference in the sources of
their materials. The conception of retributive justice pervades
the whole tragedy of the Greeks; and the maintenance of this
one animating idea is due no doubt in a great measure to the continued
treatment of a class of subjects which not only remarkably
exhibited its working, but which also were traditionally interpreted
in its light. The modern drama has no such central idea. Our
tragedy imports no dominant religious or moral conception into
the sphere of art. Even Shakespeare and Goethe, the most highly
moralized of modern dramatists, have been contented with
bringing close before our eyes the manifold spectacle of human
existence, wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ful and brilliant, from which we draw such lessons
only as can be learned from life itself. They do not undertake,
like the Greek tragedians, to supply the solution as well as
the problem. It is enough for them to exhibit humanity in conflict,
to enlist our sympathies on the side of what is noble, or to
arouse our pity by the sight of innocence in misery. The struggle
of Lear with his unnatural daughters, the death of Cordelia
when the very doors of hope have just been opened; Desdemona
dying by her husband's hand, without one opportunity of explanation;
Imogen flouted as a faithless wife; Hamlet wrestling
with Laertes in the grave of Ophelia; Juliet and Romeo brought
by a mistake to death in the May-time of their love; Faust inflicting
by his bitter gift of selfish passion woe after woe on
Margaret and her family&mdash;these are the subjects of our tragedy.
We have to content ourselves as we can with this "mask and
antimask of impassioned life, breathing, moving, acting, suffering,
laughing," and to moralize it as we may. The case is different
with Greek tragedy. There we always learn one lesson&mdash;&#964;&#8183; &#948;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;
&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, the guilty must suffer. It is only in a few such
characters as Antigone or Polyxena that pure pathos seems to
weigh down the balance of the law.</p>

<p>A minor consequence of the fixed nature of Attic tragedy was
that the dramatists calculated on no surprise in order to enlist the
interest of their audience. The name, &#338;dipus or Agamemnon,
informed the spectators what course the action of the play would
take. The art of the poet, therefore, consisted in so displaying his
characters, so preparing his incidents, and so developing the tragic
import of the tale, as to excite attention. From this arose a
peculiar style of treatment, and in particular that irony <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>of which
so much is spoken. The point, for example, about the <i>&#338;dipus
Tyrannus</i> was that the spectators knew his horrible story, but
that he did not. Therefore, every word he uttered in his pride
of prosperity was charged with sinister irony, was pregnant with
doom. Every minute incident brought him nearer to the final
crash, which all the while was ready waiting for him. In reading
this tragedy of Sophocles we seem to be watching a boatful
of careless persons gliding down a river, and gradually approaching
its fall over a vast cliff. If we take interest in them, how terrible
is our anxiety when they come within the irresistible current
of the sliding water, how frightful is their cry of anguish when at
last they see the precipice ahead, how horror-stricken is the silence
with which they shoot the fall, and are submerged! Of this nature
is the interest of a good Greek tragedy. But in the case of
the modern drama all is different. When our Elizabethan ancestors
went to the theatre to hear <i>Othello</i> for the first time, very
few of them knew the story: as the play proceeded, they could
not be sure whether Iago would finally prevail. At every moment
the outcome was doubtful. Tragic irony is, therefore, not a
common element in the modern drama. The forcible exhibition
of a new and striking subject, the gradual development of passions
in fierce conflict, the utmost amount of pathos accumulated
round the victims of malice or ill-luck, exhaust the resources of
the tragedian. The ancient dramatist plays with his cards upon
the table: the modern dramatist conceals his hand. Euripides
prefixed a prologue descriptive of the action to his pieces. Our
tragedies open only with such scenes as render the immediate
conduct of the play intelligible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>Aristotle's definition of tragedy, founded upon a vast experience,
we need not doubt, of the best Greek dramas, offers another
point of contrast between the ancient and the modern art.
"Tragedy," he says, "is an imitation of an action that is weighty,
complete, and of a proper magnitude; it proceeds by action and
not by narration; and it effects through pity and terror a purgation
of the like passions in the minds of the spectators." This
definition, which has caused great difficulty for commentators,
turns upon the meaning of the &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> or purgation, which
tragedy is supposed to effect. It is quite clear that <i>all</i> poetry
which stirs the feelings of pity and terror need not at the same
time purge them in or from the souls of the listeners, except only
in so far as true art is elevating and purifying. Therefore Aristotle
must have had some special quality of the tragic art to which
he was accustomed in his mind. His words seem to express that
it is the function of the tragic drama to appeal to our deepest
sympathies and strongest passions, to arouse them, but at the
same time to pacify them, and, as it were, to draw off the dangerous
stuff that lies upon our soul&mdash;to resolve the perturbation
of the mind in some transcendental contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> This is
what the greatest Greek tragedies achieve. They are almost invariably
closed by some sentence of the Chorus in which the unsearchableness
of God's dealings is set forth, and by which we
are made to feel that, after the fitful strife and fever of human
wills, the eternal counsels of Zeus remain unchanged, while the
moral order of the world, shaken and distorted by the passions of
heroic sufferers, abides in the serenity of the ideal. Furthermore,
there is in the very substance of almost all Greek tragedies a more
obvious healing of wounds and restorati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>on of harmony than this.
The trilogy of Prometheus was concluded by the absorption of
the Titan's vehement will in that of Zeus. The trilogy of Orestes
ends with the benediction of Pallas and Ph&#339;bus upon the
righteous man who had redeemed the errors of his house. Sophocles
allows us a glimpse of Antigone bringing peace and joy to
her father and brothers in Hades. The old &#338;dipus, after his
life-wanderings and crimes and woes, is made a blessed d&aelig;mon
through the mercy of propitiated deities. Hippolytus is reconciled
to his father, and is cheered and cooled in his death-fever by
the presence of the maiden Artemis. Thus the terror and pity
which have been roused in each of these cases are allayed by the
actual climax of the plot which has excited them: grief itself becomes
a chariot for surmounting the sources of grief. But the
modern drama does not offer this &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;: its passions too often
remain unreconciled in their original antagonism: the note on
which the symphony terminates is not unfrequently discordant
or exciting. Where is the &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962; in <i>King Lear</i>? Are our
passions purged in any definite sense by the close of the first
part of <i>Faust</i>? We are rather left with the sense of inexpiable
guilt and unalleviated suffering, with yearnings excited which
shall never be quelled. The greatest works of modern fiction&mdash;the
novels of Balzac, with their philosophy of wickedness triumphant;
the novels of George Eliot, with their dismal lesson of
the feebleness of human effort; the tragedies of Shakespeare,
with the silence of the grave for their conclusion&mdash;intensify and
embitter that "struggle to be what we are not, and to do what
we cannot" which Hazlitt gives as an equivalent for life.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
greatest creative poet of this generation writes &#7936;&#957;&#8049;&#947;&#954;&#951; upon his
title-page. The chief poet of the century makes his hero exclaim:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such purification of the passions as modern art achieves is to be
found most eminently in the choric movements of Handel, in the
symphonies of Beethoven, in all the great achievements of music.
Ancient art aimed at the perfect within definite limits, because
human life in the ancient world was circumscribed by mundane
limitations, and its conditions were unhesitatingly accepted. Our
art aims at the infinite, because we are forever striving after a
completion which cannot be attained. It was not for nothing
that Christianity, with its widening of spiritual horizons, closed
the ancient and inaugurated the modern age:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Une immense esp&eacute;rance a travers&eacute; la terre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malgr&eacute; nous vers le ciel il faut lever les yeux.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In that fixed mood of restless expectation, in that persistent attitude
of the soul upraised to sweep the heavens, there lies the secret
of modern art. Life to the Greek belonged to the category
of &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#962;, or the definite: it was like a crystal in its well-defined
consistency. Our life, whether we regard it from the point of
view of science or of religion, belongs to the &#7940;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957;, or the un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>determined:
it is only one term of an infinite series, the significance
whereof is relative to the unknown quantities beyond it. Consequently
modern art is nowhere satisfied with merely &aelig;sthetic
forms. The soul with its maladies imperiously demands expression.
Michael Angelo was not contented, like Pheidias or Praxiteles,
with carving the serenity of godlike men and women. In
the figures upon the tombs of the Medici he fashioned four moods
of the tortured, aching, anguished soul, to whom the burden of
this life is all but intolerable. His frescos in the Sistine Chapel
are subordinated to the expression of one thought&mdash;the doom of
God which will descend upon the soul of man. Christianity destroyed
beyond all possibility of reconstruction the free, frank
sensuality of paganism. It convicted humanity of sin, and taught
men to occupy themselves with the internal warfare of their flesh
and spirit as that which is alone eternally important. Life itself,
according to the modern formula, is a conflict which will be concluded
one way or the other beyond the grave. Meanwhile upon
this earth the conflict is undetermined. Therefore art, which reflects
life, represents the battle, and dares not to anticipate its outcome.
In this relation the very pathology of the soul becomes
poetic. &#7960;&#961;&#8118;&#957; &#7936;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;, said the Greek proverb, &#957;&#8057;&#963;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962;&mdash;to
desire impossible things is a disease of the soul. But
<i>l'amour de l'impossible</i>&mdash;the straining of the soul after the infinite,
the desire to approximate in this world to a dream of the
ecstatic fancy&mdash;all the rapture of saints, the self-denial of solitaries,
the death in life of penitents&mdash;is not defined by us as a
disease. On the contrary, this passion for the impossible has
been held through many centuries of modern history to be the
truest sign of the soul's health; and even where such superstition
has not penetrated, poets like Byron have prided themselves upon
the same temper di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>splayed in their extravagant yearnings. Don
Juan, enormous in his appetite for pleasure, and rebellious on the
grave's brink beneath the hand of God; Faust, insatiable of curiosity,
and careless of eternity in his lust for power; Tannh&auml;user,
pursuing to the end his double life of love too sweet to be abandoned
and of conscience too acutely sensitive to be stilled; these
are our modern legends. These, with so little of mere action in
them, so much of inner meaning and mental experience, yield the
truest materials to our artists. Over and over again have Faust,
Tannh&auml;user, and Don Juan supplied the poet with subjects wherein
no merely local or temporary tragedy is set forth, but the destiny
of the modern man is shown as in a magic mirror. Nor has
the advent of science as yet restored our mind to that "passionless
bride, divine tranquillity," which the Greeks enjoyed, and
which alone could be the mother of such art as the antique. Although
the sublime cheerfulness of Goethe shows by way of forecast
how the scientific mood may lead to this result hereafter, for
the present science has deepened and complicated our most distressing
problems, has rendered the anxiety of man about his destiny
still more cruel, has made him still more helpless in the effort
to comprehend his relations to the universe, by seeming to
prove that his most cherished hypotheses are mere illusions.
Like a spoiled child, who has been taught to expect too much, to
think about himself too much, and to rely too much on flattery,
humanity, shrinking from the cold, calm atmosphere of science,
still cries in feverish accents with St. Paul: "If Christ be not
risen, then are we of men most wretched!" How strange would
that sentence have sounded to Sophocles! How well it suits
the tragedy of Shakespeare, which has for its ultimate Vers&ouml;hnung
the hope, felt, though unexpressed, of St. Paul's exclamation!</p>

<p>As a corollary to what has hitherto been said about the differences
between the drama of Sophocles and that of Shakespeare, it
follows that the former aims at depicting the destinies, and the
latter the characters of men.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Shakespeare exhibits individual
wills <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>and passions clashing together and producing varied patterns
in the web of life. Sophocles unfolds schemes and sequences of
doomed events, where individual wills and passions play indeed
their part, but where they are subordinated to the idea which the
tragedian undertakes to illustrate. A play of &AElig;schylus or Sophocles
strikes us by the grandeur of the whole: a play of Shakespeare
or Goethe overwhelms us by the force and frequence of
combined and interacting motives. No analysis can be too
searching or acute for the profound conception which pervades
the <i>Oresteia</i> of &AElig;schylus; but there is no single character in
&AElig;schylus or in Sophocles so worthy of minute investigation as
that of Hamlet or of Faust. If a critic looks to the general effect
of a tragedy, to the power of imagination displayed in its conception
as a single work of art, he will prefer the <i>Agamemnon</i> to
<i>Macbeth</i>; but if he seek for the creation of a complete and subtle
human soul, he will abandon Clytemnestra for the Thane of
Cawdor's wife. The antique drama aims at the presentation of
tragic situations, determined and controlled by some mysterious
force superior to the agents. The modern aims at the presentation
of tragic situations, immediately produced and brought about
by the free action of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>One advantage which the modern dramatist has over the ancient
is that he may introduce very numerous persons in concerted
action without the danger of confusion, and that of these many
may be female. It has been ably argued by De Quincey that the
Attic tragedians had small opportunity of studying the female
character, and that it would have been indecorous for them to
have painted women with the perfect freedom of a Cleopatra or
a Vittoria Corombona.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Consequently their women are either
superficially and slightly sketched like Ismene and Chrysothemis;
or else they are marked by something masculine, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> the case
of Clytemnestra and Medea; or again they move our sympathy
not by the perfection of their womanliness but by the exhibition
of some simple and sublime self-sacrifice&mdash;notable examples being
the filial devotion of Antigone, the sisterly affection of Electra,
the uncomplaining submission of Iphigeneia and Polyxena, the
wifely self-abandonment of Alcestis, the almost frigid acquiescence
in death of Makaria. The later Greek drama, and especially
the drama of Euripides, abounded in these characters. They are
incarnations of certain moral qualities. Like the masks which
concealed the actor's face, they show one fixed and sustained
mood of emotion: we find in them no hesitancy and difficult resolve,
no ebb and flow of wavering inclination, but one immutable,
magnificent, heroic fixity of purpose. In a word, they are
conformed to the sculptural type of the Greek tragic art.</p>

<p>Owing to the very structure of the Attic stage, Greek tragedy
could never have recourse to those formless, vague, and unsubstantial
sources of terror and of charm which the modern dramatist
has at his command. How could such airy nothings as the
elves of the <i>Tempest</i>, the fairies of <i>A Midsummer Nights-Dream</i>,
or the witches of <i>Macbeth</i> have been brought upon that colossal
theatre in the full blaze of an Athenian noon? Figures of Thanatos
and of Lyssa did indeed appear: the ghost of Clytemnestra
roused the sleeping Furies in the courts of Delphi: the phantom
of Darius hovered over his grave. But these spectres were sculpturesque&mdash;such
as Pheidias might have carved in marble, and such
as we see painted on so-called Etruscan vases. They were not
Banquo-apparitions gliding into visible substance from the vacant
gloom and retiring thitherward again. When such creatures of
the diseased imagination had to be suggested, the seer, like Cassandra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>,
before whose eyes the phantoms of the children of Thyestes
passed, or Orestes, who drew his arrows upon an unseen cohort
of threatening fiends, stared on vacancy. Shakespeare dares
at times to realize such incorporeal beings, to give to them a voice
and a visible form. Yet it may be doubted whether even in his
tremendous supernatural apparatus the voice which shrieked to
Macbeth "Sleep no more!" the mutterings of Lady Macbeth in
her somnambulism, the spectre which Hamlet saw and his mother
could not see, the dream of Clarence with its cry of injured ghosts,
are not really the most appalling.</p>

<p>The Greek drama owed its power to the qualities of regularity
and simplicity: the strength of the modern lies in subtlety and
multiplicity. The external conditions of the Attic theatre, no less
than the prevailing spirit of Greek tragic art, forced this simplicity
and regularity upon the ancient dramatists. These conditions
do not occur in the modern world. We have our little theatres,
our limited audience, our unmasked actors, our scenical illusions,
our freedom in the choice of subjects. Therefore to push the
subtlety and multiplicity of tragic composition to the utmost&mdash;to
arrange for the most swift and sudden changes of expression in
the actor, for the most delicate development of a many-sided character,
for the most complicated grouping of contrasted forms, and
for the utmost realization of imaginative incidents&mdash;is the glory
of a Shakespeare or a Goethe. The French dramatists made the
mistake of clinging to the beggarly elements of the Attic stage,
when they had no means of restoring its colossal grandeur. When
it was open to them to rival the work of the ancients in a new
and truly modern style, they hampered their genius by arbitrary
rules, and thought that t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>hey were following the principles of the
highest art, while they submitted to the mere necessities of a bygone
form of presentation. If Racine had believed in Nemesis, if
Versailles had afforded him a theatre and an audience like that of
Athens, if his actors had worn masks, if sculpture had been the
dominant art of modern Europe, he would have been following
the right track. As it was, he became needlessly formal. The
same blind enthusiasm for antiquity led to the doctrine of the
unities, to the abstinence from bloodshed on the stage, and to
the restriction of a play to five acts. Horace had advised a dramatist
not to extend his tragedy beyond the fifth act, nor to allow
Medea to murder her children within sight of the audience. All
modern playwrights observe the rule of five acts: nor is there
much to be said against it, except that the third act is apt to be
languid for want of matter. But the Greeks disregarded this division:
judging by the choric songs, we find that some of their
tragedies have as many as seven, and some as few as two acts.
Again, as to bloodshed on the stage, it is probable that if the
Greek actors had not been so clumsily arrayed, we should have
had many instances of their violation of this rule. &AElig;schylus discloses
the shambles where Agamemnon and Cassandra lie weltering
in their blood, and hammers a stake through the body of Prometheus.
Sophocles exhibits &#338;dipus with eyes torn out and
bleeding on his cheeks. Euripides allows the mangled corpse of
Astyanax to be brought upon the stage on his father's shield.
There is nothing more ghastly in an actual murder than in these
spectacles of slaughter and mutilation. With reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>unities, the French critics demand that a drama shall proceed in
the same place, and the playwrights are at infinite pains to manage
that no change of scene shall occur. But Aristotle, whose authority
they claim, is silent on the point; while the usage of the
Greek drama shows more than one change of place&mdash;especially in
the <i>Ajax</i> of Sophocles and in the <i>Eumenides</i> of &AElig;schylus, where
the scene is shifted from the temple of Ph&#339;bus at Delphi to the
Areopagus at Athens. Still the exigencies of the Greek theatre
made it advisable to alter the centre of action as little as possible;
and as a matter of convenience this requirement was complied
with. The circumstances of our own stage have removed this
difficulty, and it is only on the childish principle of maintaining
an impossible illusion that the unity of place can be observed with
any propriety. The unity of time has more to say for itself.
Aristotle remarks that it is better to have a drama completed
within the space of a day: this rule flows from his just sense of
the proportion of parts; a work of art ought to be such that the
mind can easily comprehend it at a glance. Yet many Greek
plays, such as the <i>Agamemnon</i> of &AElig;schylus, where Agamemnon
has time to return from Troy, or the <i>Eumenides</i>, where Orestes
performs the journey from Delphi to Athens, disregard this rule
in cases where it required no strain of the mind to bridge over
the space of a few unimportant days or hours. When in the
modern drama we are introduced to the hero of a play first as a
child and then as a full-grown man, and are forced meanwhile to
keep our attention on his acts in the interval as important to the
dramatic evolution, there is a gross violation of &aelig;sthetical unity.
About the unity of action all critics are agreed. It is the same
as unity of interest, or unity of subject, the interest and the subject
of a play being its action. A good tragedy must have but
one action, just as a good epic or a good poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> of any sort must
have but one subject; for the simple reason that, as the eye cannot
look at two things at once, so the mind cannot attend to two
things at once. Modern poets have been apt to disregard this
canon of common-sense: the underplots of many plays and the
episodes of such epics as the <i>Orlando</i> of Ariosto are not sufficiently
subordinated to the main design or interwoven with it. Aristotle
is also right in saying that the unity of the hero is not the
same as the unity of action: a play, for example, on the labors of
Hercules could only be made a good drama if each labor were
shown to be one step in the fulfilment of one divinely appointed
task. Shakespeare has complied with the canon of the unity of
action in all his tragedies. Whether Goethe has done so in <i>Faust</i>
may admit of doubt. The identity of his hero seems to him sufficient
for the tragic unity of his piece; yet he has given us another
centre of interest in Margaret, whose story is but a mere
episode in the experience of Faust. Unity of action in a tragedy,
the very soul of which is action, is the same as organic coherence
in a body; and therefore, as every work of art ought, according
to the energetic metaphor of Plato, to be a living creature, with
head, trunk, and limbs all vitalized by one thought, this unity is
essential. Admitting this point, we may fairly say that the other
rules of French dramatic criticism are not only arbitrary, but also
founded on a mistake with regard to the Greek theatre and a misapprehension
of the proper functions of the modern stage. Composing
in obedience to them is like walking upon stilts in a country
where there are no marshes to make the inconvenience necessary.</p>

<p>In this review of the differences between our own tragedy and
that of the Greeks I have scarcely touched upon those primary
qualities which diffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>rentiate all modern from ancient art. The
"sentiment of the infinite," which Renan regards as the chief legacy
of medi&aelig;valism to modern civilization, and the preoccupation
with the internal spirit rather than the external form which makes
music the essentially modern, as sculpture was the essentially ancient
art, are causes of innumerable peculiarities in our conception
of tragedy. I have hardly alluded to these, but have endeavored
to show that the immersion of Greek tragedy in religious ideas,
the fixed body of mythical matter handled by the Greek dramatists
in succession, and the actual conditions of the Attic theatre, will
account for the greater number of those characteristics which distinguish
Sophocles from Shakespeare, the prince of Greek from
the prince of modern tragic poets.</p>

in the Attic drama. It has been censured by some critics as being unreasonably
protracted. In reality it is in perfect accordance with the whole spirit
of Greek tragedy. The emotions are brought into artistic relief: the figures
are grouped like mourners on a sculptured monument: the antiphonal dirges
of the princess and her attendants set the pulses of our sympathy in rhythmic
movement, so that grief itself becomes idealized and glorified. The
depth of feeling expressed, and the highly wrought form of its expression,
together tend to rouse and chasten all that is profound and dignified in our
emotions. Strophe after strophe, heart-beat by heart-beat, this wonderfully
cadenced funeral song of her who is the bride of Acheron proceeds until the

pointed out to me by my friend, Mr. E. Abbot, of Balliol College, that Aristotle,
in another passage of the <i>Poetics</i> (xvii. 8), uses the word in a lustral
meaning. The reference to it in a weighty passage of the <i>Politics</i> (viii. 7, 4)

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> In the Greek drama the notion of fate was primarily theological: the
hero was conducted to his end by gods. In Shakespeare Fate is psychological;
Hamlet's own character is his destiny. In Goethe, Victor Hugo, and
George Eliot the conception of Fate has passed into the region of positivism:
the laws of blood, society, and race rule individuals in the <i>Elective Affinities</i>,
<i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>, the <i>Spanish Gypsy</i>. The modern analogue for Greek
hereditary destiny, traceable to some original transgression and tainting all
the action of a doomed family, is to be found in madness, which has as yet
been tragically treated by no dramatist of the first rank.</p></div>

work of fiction. We do not actually see the secret workings of the mainsprings
of personality. We judge a hero of Sophocles by his actions and
by his relations to other men and women more than by his soliloquies or by
scenes specially constructed to expose his qualities. In this respect Greek
tragedy again resembles Greek sculpture. As in their sculpture the Greek
artists felt the muscular structure of the human frame with exquisite sensibility,
while they did not obtrude it upon the spectator, so in their tragedy
the poets preferred to exhibit the results rather than to lay bare the process
of mental and emotional activity. The modern tragedian shifts his ground
somewhat, but he chooses an equally legitimate province of poetry when he
discloses the inmost labyrinths in the character of a Hamlet or a Faust.</p></div>

<p>"A deep idea of world-destruction (<i>Weltvernichtungsidee</i><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>)
lies at the root of every Aristophanic comedy, and, like a fantastically
ironical magic tree, springs up in it with blooming ornament
of thoughts, with singing nightingales, and climbing, chattering
apes." This is a sentence translated from the German of
Heinrich Heine, who, of all poets, was the one best fitted to appreciate
the depth of Aristophanes, to pierce beneath his smiling
comic mask, and to read the underlying Weltvernichtungsidee
with what he calls its "jubilee of death and fireworks of annihilation."
Perhaps, as is common with German writers of imagination,
Heine pushes his point too far, and insists with too much
force upon the "jubilee of death," "the fireworks of annihilation."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>The strong wine of his own paradox intoxicates his judgment,
and his taste is somewhat perverted by the Northern tendency
to brood upon the more fantastic aspects of his subject. It
is not so much Aristophanes himself whom Heine sees, as Aristophanes
reflected in the magic mirror of his own melancholy and
ironical fancy. Yet, after making these deductions, the criticism
I have quoted seems to me to be the proper preface to all serious
study of the greatest comic poet of the world. It strikes the true
key-note, and tunes our apprehension to the right pitch; for, in
approaching Aristophanes, we must divest our minds of all the ordinary
canons and definitions of comedy: we must forget what
we have learned from Plautus and Terence, from Moli&egrave;re and Jonson.
No modern poet, except perhaps Shakespeare and Calderon
in parts, will help us to understand him. We must not expect to
find the gist of Aristophanes in vivid portraits of character, in situations
borrowed from every-day life, in witty dialogues, in carefully
constructed plots arriving at felicitous conclusions. All
these elements, indeed, he has; but these are not the main points
of his art. His plays are not comedies in the sense in which we
use the word, but scenic allegories, Titanic farces in which the
whole creation is turned upside down; transcendental travesties,
enormous orgies of wild fancy and unbridled imagination; Dionysiac
dances in which tears are mingled with laughter, and fire with
wine; Choruses that, underneath their oceanic merriment of leaping
waves, hide silent deeps of unstirred thought. If Coleridge
was justified in claiming the German word <i>Lustspiel</i> for the so-called
comedies of Shakespeare, we have a far greater right to appropriate
this wide and pregnant title to the plays of Aristophanes.
The brazen mask which crowns his theatre smiles indeed
broadly, serenely, as if its mirth embraced the universe; but its
hollow eye-sockets suggest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>infinite possibilities of profoundest
irony. Buffoonery carried to the point of paradox, wisdom disguised
as insanity, and gayety concealing the whole sum of human
disappointment, sorrow, and disgust, seem ready to escape from
its open but rigid lips, which are moulded to a proud, perpetual
laughter. It is a laughter which spares neither God nor man&mdash;which
climbs Olympus only to drag down the immortals to its
scorn, and trails the pall of august humanity in the mire; but
which, amid its mockery and blasphemy, seems everlastingly asserting,
as by paradox, that reverence of the soul which bends our
knees to Heaven and makes us respect our brothers. There is
nothing sinister or even serious in Aristophanes. He did not
write in the sarcastic, cynical old age of his nation or his era. He
is rather the voice of its superabundant youthfulness: his genius
is like a young man sporting in his scorn of danger with the
thought of death; like Achilles, in the sublimity of his beauty,
mimicking the gestures of Thersites. Nor, again, are his thoughts
shaded down, concealed, wrapped up in symbols. On the contrary,
the very "Weltvernichtungsidee," of which Heine speaks,
leaps forth and spreads its wings beneath the full blaze of Athenian
noonday, showing a glorious face, as of sculptured marble,
and a comely person unashamed. It is not the morbid manifestation
of sour secretions and unnatural juices, but the healthy
product of keen vitality and perfectly harmonious functions. Into
the clear light his paradoxes, and his irony, and his unblushing
satire spring like song-birds rejoicing in their flight.</p>

<p>Then, again, how miraculously beautiful are "the blooming ornament
of thoughts," "the nightingales and climbing apes," of
which we spoke! No poet&mdash;not even Shelley&mdash;has exceeded the
Choruses of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>e <i>Birds</i> and <i>Clouds</i> in swiftness, radiance, and condensed
imagination. Shakespeare alone, in his <i>Midsummer-Night's
Dream</i> and the <i>Tempest</i>; or Calderon, in some of his allegorical
dramas, carries us away into the same enchanted land, where the
air is purer and the skies seem larger than in our world; where
the stars burn with treble lustre, and where the flowers harbor
visible spirits&mdash;elfs and Ariels clinging to the branches, and dazzling
fireflies tangled in the meadow-grass beneath our feet. Nor
is it only by this unearthly splendor of visionary loveliness that
Aristophanes attracts us. Beauty of a more mundane and sensual
sort is his. Multitudes of brilliant ever-changing figures fill the
scene; and here and there we find a landscape or a piece of music
and moonlight glowing with the presence of the vintage god.
Bacchic processions of young men and maidens move before us,
tossing inspired heads wreathed with jasmine flowers and wet with
wine. The Myst&aelig; in the meadows of Elysium dance their rounds
with the clash of cymbals and with madly twinkling snow-white
feet. We catch glimpses at intervals of Athenian banquets, of
midnight serenades, of the pal&aelig;stra with its crowd of athletes, of
the Panathenaic festival as Pheidias carved it, of all the busy
rhythmic colored life of Greece.</p>

<p>The difficulty of treating Aristophanes in an essay is twofold.
There are first of all those obstacles which every writer on so old
a subject has to meet. Aristophanes, like all Greek poets, has
been subjected to prolonged and most minute criticism. He has
formed a part of classical education for centuries, and certain
views about his poetry, substantially correct, have become a fixed
element in our literary consciousness. Thus every fresh writer on
the old comedy of Athens must take a good deal of knowledge
for granted in his readers&mdash;but what, and how much, he hardly
knows. He may expect them to be acquainted with the details
furnished by scholars like Donaldson about the times at which
comedies were exhibited, the manner of their presentation on the
stage, and the change from th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>e old to the middle and new periods.
He may suppose that they will know that Aristophanes stood in
the same relation to Cratinus as Sophocles to &AElig;schylus; that the
<i>Clouds</i> had not so much to do with the condemnation of Socrates
as some of the later Greek gossips attempted to make out; that
Aristophanes was conservative in politics, philosophy, and literature,
vehemently opposing the demagogues, the sophists, and Euripides.
Again, he may, or rather he must, avoid the ground
which has been so well trodden by Schlegel, M&uuml;ller, and Mitchell,
in their familiar criticisms of Aristophanes; and he may content
himself with a passing allusion to Grote's discussion of the <i>Clouds</i>.
But though, from this point of view, Aristophanes is almost stale
from having been so much written about and talked about and alluded
to&mdash;though in fact there is a <i>prima facie</i> obligation imposed
on every one who makes his plays the subject of fresh criticism
to pretend at least to some originality of view or statement&mdash;still
Aristophanes has never yet been fairly dealt with or submitted
to really dispassionate consideration. Thus he shares, in
common with all poets of antiquity, the disabilities of being hackneyed,
while he has the peculiar and private disability of never
having been really appreciated at his worth except by a few scholars
and enthusiastic poets. The reason for this want of intelligence
in the case of Aristophanes is not hard to see. First of all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>his plays are very difficult. Their allusions require much learned
illustration. Their vocabulary is copious and rare. So that none
but accomplished Grecians or devoted students of literature can
hope to read him with much pleasure to themselves. In a translation
his special excellence is almost unrecognizable. Next&mdash;and
this is the real reason why Aristophanes has been unfairly dealt
with, as well as the source of the second class of difficulties which
meet his interpreters&mdash;it is hard for the modern Christian world
to tolerate his freedom of speech and coarseness. Of all the
Greeks, essentially a nude nation, he is the most naked&mdash;the most
audacious in his revelation of all that human nature is supposed
to seek to hide. The repugnance felt for his ironical <i>insouciance</i>
and for his profound indelicacy has prevented us from properly
valuing his poetry. Critics begin their panegyrics of him with
apologies; they lift their skirts and tread delicately, passing over
his broadest humor <i>sicco pede</i>, picking their way among his heterogeneous
images, winking and blinking, hesitating and condoning,
omitting a passage here, attempting to soften an allusion there,
until the real Aristophanes has almost disappeared. Yet there is
no doubt that this way of dealing with our poet will not do.
The time has come at which any writer on Greek literature, if not
content to pass by Aristophanes in silence, must view him as he
is, and casting aside for a moment at least the veil of modern propriety,
must be prepared to admit that this great comic genius
was "far too naked to be shamed."</p>

<p>So important is this point in the whole of its bearing upon
Aristophanes that I may perhaps be allowed to explain the peculiar
position which he occupies, and, without seeking to offer any
exculpation for what offends us in the moral sensibilities of the
Greeks, to show how such a product as the comedy of Aristophanes
took root and grew in Athens. His plays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> I have already
said, are not comedies in the modern sense, but Lustspiele&mdash;fantastic
entertainments, debauches of the reason and imagination.
The poet, when he composed them, knew that he was writing for
an audience of Greeks, inebriated with the worship of the vintage
god, ivy-crowned, and thrilling to the sound of orgiastic flutes.
Therefore, we who read him in the cool shades of modern Protestantism,
excited by no Dionysiac rites, forced to mine and quarry
at his jests with grammar, lexicon, and commentary, unable,
except by the exercise of the historical imagination, to conceive
of a whole nation agreeing to honor its god by frantic license,
must endeavor to check our natural indignation, and by no means
to expect from Aristophanes such views of life as are consistent
with our sober mood. We cannot, indeed, exactly apply to the
case of Aristophanes those clever sophistries by which Charles
Lamb defended the comic poets of our Restoration, when he said
that they had created an unreal world, and that, allowing for their
fictitious circumstances, the perverse morality of their plays was
not only pardonable, but even necessary. Yet it is true that his
audacious immodesty forms a part of that Weltvernichtungsidee,
of that total upturn and Titanic revolution in the universe which
he affects; and so far we may plead in his defence, and in the
defence of the Athenian spectators, that his comedies were consciously
exaggerated in their coarseness, and that beyond the limits
of the Dionysiac festival their jokes would not have been tolerated.
To use a metaphor, his plays were offered as a sacrifice
upon the thymel&eacute; or orchestral altar of that Bacchus who was sire
by Aphrodite of Priapus: this potent deity protected them; and
the poet, as his true and loyal priest, was bound, in return for
such protection, to represent the universe at large as conquered by
the madness of intoxication, beauty, and d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>esire. Thus the Aristophanic
comedies are in one sense a radiant and pompous show, by
which the genius of the Greek race chose, as it were in bravado,
to celebrate an apotheosis of the animal functions of humanity;
and from this point of view we may fairly accept them as visions,
Dionysiac day-dreams, from which the nation woke and rose and
went about its business soberly, until the Bacchic flutes were heard
again another year.</p>

<p>On the religious origin of Greek comedy some words may perhaps
be reckoned not out of place in this connection. It has frequently
been pointed out to what a great extent the character of
the Aristophanic comedy was determined by its sacred nature,
and by the peculiar condition of semi-religious license which prevailed
at Athens during the celebration of the festival of Bacchus.
We know that much is tolerated in a Roman or Venetian carnival
which would not be condoned at other seasons of the year.
Yet the Italian carnival, in its palmiest days, must have offered
but a very poor and frigid picture of what took place in Athens
at the Dionysia, nor was the expression of the crudest sensuality
ever thought agreeable to any modern saint. That the Greeks
most innocently and simply wished to prove their piety by these
excesses is quite clear. Aristophanes himself, in the <i>Acharnians</i>,
gives us an example of the primitive phallic hymn, which formed
the nucleus of comedy in its rudest stage. The refrain of &#966;&#945;&#955;&#8134;&#962;,
&#7953;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#949; &#914;&#945;&#954;&#967;&#8055;&#959;&#965;, &#958;&#8059;&#947;&#954;&#969;&#956;&#949;, &#957;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#949;, &#956;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#8051; sufficiently indicates
its nature. Again, the Choruses of the Myst&aelig; in the <i>Frogs</i> furnish
a still more brilliant example of the interminglement of debauchery
with a spirit of true piety, of sensual pleasure with pure-souled
participation in divine bliss. Their hymns to Iacchus and
De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>meter alternate between the holiest strains of praise and the
most scurrilous satire. At one time they chant the delights of
the meadows blooming with the rose; at another they raise cries
of jubilant intoxication and fierce frenzy. In the same breath
with the utterance of sensual passion they warn all profane persons
and impure livers to avoid their rites, and boast that for
them alone the light of heaven is gladsome who have forsworn
impiety and preserved the justice due to friends and strangers.
We must imagine that this phallic ecstasy, if we may so name it,
had become, as it were, organized and reduced to system in the
Aristophanic Lustspiel. It permeates and gives a flavor to the
comic style long after it has been absorbed and superseded by the
weightier interests of developed art. This ecstasy implied a profound
sympathy with nature in her large and perpetual reproductiveness,
a mysterious sense of the sexuality which pulses in all
members of the universe and reaches consciousness in man. It
encouraged a momentary subordination of the will and intellect
and nobler feelings to the animal propensities, prompting the
same race which had produced the sculptures of the Parthenon,
the tragedies of &AElig;schylus, the deeds of Pericles and Leonidas, the
self-control of Socrates, the thought of Plato, to throw aside its
royal mantle of supreme humanity, and to proclaim in a gigantic
work of art the irreconcilable incongruity which exists between
the physical nature and the spirit of the man, when either side of
the antithesis is isolated for exclusive contemplation. We need
not here point out how far removed was the phallic ecstasy from
any prurient delight in licentious details, or from the scientific
analysis of passions. Nor, on the other hand, need we indicate
the vein of a similar extravagant enthusiasm in Oriental poetry.
It is enough to remember that it existed latent in all the comic
dramas of the earlier period, throbbing through them as the <i>s&egrave;ve
de la jeunesse</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>palpitates in youthful limbs and adds a glow and
glory to the inconsiderate or unseemly acts of an Alcibiades or
Antony. Christianity, by introducing a new conception of the
physical relations of humanity, by regarding the body as the temple
of the spirit, utterly rejected and repudiated this delirium of
the senses, this voluntary acceptance of merely animal conditions.
Christianity taught mankind, what the Greeks had never learned,
that it is our highest duty to be at discord with the universe upon
this point. Man, whose subtle nature might be compared to a
many-stringed instrument, is bidden to restrain the resonance of
those chords which do not thrill in unison with purely spiritual
and celestial harmonies. Hence the theories of celibacy and asceticism,
and of the sinfulness of carnal pleasure, which are wholly
alien to Greek moral and religious notions. Never since the age
of Athenian splendor has a rational and highly civilized nation
dared to express by any solemn act its sense of union with merely
physical nature. Aristophanes is therefore the poet of a past age,
the "hierophant of a now unapprehended mystery," the unique
remaining example of an almost unlimited genius set apart and
consecrated to a cultus which subsequent civilization has determined
to annihilate. The only age which offers anything like a
parallel to the Athenian era of Aristophanes is that of the Italian
Renaissance. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, at Venice,
Florence, and Rome, it seemed as if the phallic ecstasy might
possibly revive, as if the animal nature of man might again be deified,
in sentiment at least, and as if the highest arts might stoop
once more to interpret and to consecrate the poetry of the senses.
But the conscience of the world was changed; and this could no
longer be. The image of Christ crowned with thorns had passed
across the centuries; hopes undrea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>med of by the Greeks had
aroused a new spirit in the soul of man, and had forced him in
spite of inclination to lift his eyes from earth to heaven. Over
the joys of the flesh, which were connected with a future doom
of pain unending and disgrace, was shed a hue of gloom and horror.
Conception was looked upon as sin, birth as disaster. It
was even doubted whether for any but for virgins, except by some
special privilege of election, salvation could be hoped. Therefore,
while the Greeks had been innocent in their serene unconsciousness
of sin or shame, the extravagances of the Renaissance were
guilty, turbid, and morbid, because they were committed defiantly,
in open reprobacy, in scorn of the acknowledged law. What was
at worst bestial in the Greeks has become devilish in the Renaissance.
How different from a true Greek is Benvenuto Cellini:
how unlike the monsters even of Greek mythic story is Francesco
Cenci: how far more awful in his criminality is the Borgia than
any despot of Greek colony or island! I have been somewhat
led astray from the point in view, which was to prove that the
comedies of Aristophanes embody a peculiar and temporary,
though recurring and recognized, phase of Greek feeling&mdash;that
they owe their license in a great measure to their religious origin
and to the enthusiasm of the Bacchic ecstasy.</p>

<p>But what has just been said about the difference between Athenian
Greece and the Italian Renaissance will show that Aristophanes
has a still more solid ground of defence in the fact that
he was thoroughly in harmony with the moral sense of his age
and nation, and that the Bacchic license was only an exaggeration
of more ordinary habits, both of thought and action. It must be
acknowledged that the Greeks were devoid of what we call shame
and delicacy in respect of their bodies. It was only in the extreme
old age of the Greek race, and under t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>he dominion of Oriental
mysticism, that the Alexandrian Plotinus was heard to exclaim
that he blushed because he had a body. The true Greeks,
on the contrary, were proud of the body, loved to display their
physical perfections, felt no shame of any physical needs, were
not degraded by the exercise of any animal function, nay poetized
the pleasures of the flesh. Simonides, in his lines on happiness,
prays first for health and next for beauty; and a thousand passages
might be quoted to prove how naturally and sincerely the
Greeks reckoned physical beauty among the chief goods of life, and
how freely they exhibited it in all its splendor. As a slight indication
of the popular feeling, we might quote the reproof for effeminacy
which Aristophanes utters against the young men who
thought it necessary to appear clothed at the Panathenaic festival;
from which it is clear that the Greek conscience connected
nudity with purity. The immense value attached to physical
beauty is evident even from their military history&mdash;from the record,
for instance, of Callicrates among the heroes of Plat&aelig;a, simply
because he was the fairest of the Greeks who fought that day.
Again, Herodotus tells of one Philippus, who joined in the expedition
of Dorieus against Eryx, and who, being slain and stripped
by the people of Segeste, was taken up by his foes and nobly
buried, and thereafter worshipped as a hero on account of his exceeding
beauty. The influence which the sight of beauty exercised
over the gravest of the Greeks is proved by the story of
Phryne before the Areopagus, and by what Plato tells of Socrates
at the beginning of the <i>Charmides</i>. How it could electrify a nation
asse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>mbled in the theatre is shown by Plutarch's story of the
slave whom Nicias set free for winning the applause of all Athens
when acting Dionysus, and by Xenophon's tale about another
Dorieus whom the Athenians, though he was their deadly foe, released
ransomless and scathless, after he had been captured and
sent to Attica, because he was a very goodly man. Nor was it
the sense of beauty only, or the open exhibition of the person,
which marked the Greeks. Besides this, and perhaps flowing
from it, we find in them an extraordinary callousness with regard
to many things which we think shocking and degrading in the
last degree. The mere fact that Alcibiades, while a minister of
the Athenian people, could have told the tales of his youth, recorded
in Plato's Banquet, or that grave men could have contended
without reserve for the favor of distinguished courtesans,
proves that the Athenian public was ready to accept whatever
Aristophanes might set before them&mdash;not to take his jokes scornfully,
as a Roman patron trifled with the <i>faceti&aelig;</i> of his <i>Gr&aelig;culus
esuriens</i>, but, while enjoying them, to respect their author.</p>

<p>Nor is Aristophanes without another solid ground of defence
on the score of sincerity and healthiness. In his immodesty there
is nothing morbid, though it is expressed more crudely than suits
the moral dignity of man. Aristophanes is never prurient, never
in bad taste or vulgar. He has none of the obscenity which revolts
us in Swift, who uses filth in order to degrade and violate
our feelings; none of the nastiness of Moli&egrave;re or Pope, whose
courtly and polished treatment of disgusting subjects is a disgrace
to literature; none of the coarseness of Ben Jonson; none of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>far more indecent innuendo which contaminates the writings of
humorists like Sterne and satirists like Voltaire, who seem always
trying, childishly or apishly, to tamper with forbidden things.
Aristophanes accepts licentiousness as a fact which needs no apology:
he does not, as the moderns do, mingle it with sentiment,
or indulge in it on the sly. He has no <i>polissonnerie</i>: the <i>vice
&eacute;grillard</i> of the French (from whom we are obliged to borrow
these phrases) is unknown to him. His license is large, serene,
sane, statuesque, self-approved. His sensuality is nonchalant and
natural&mdash;so utterly devoid of shame, so thoroughly at home and
well contented with itself, that it has no perturbation, no defiance,
no mysterious attractiveness. Besides, he is ironical; his &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#968;&#969;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;
and &#949;&#8016;&#961;&#8059;&#960;&#961;&#969;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#953; promenade in noonday, and get laughed
at, instead of being stoned and hooted down. About the audacious
scene between Kinesias and Murrhine, in the <i>Lysistrata</i>,
there is no Aretine hircosity. It is merely comic&mdash;a farcical incident,
selected, not for the rankness of its details, but for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> dramatic
capabilities. The same may be said about the termination
of the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i> and the scene in the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i>, which
so vividly illustrates the working of one law in the new commonwealth.
So innocent in his unconsciousness is Aristophanes that
he rarely condescends even to satirize the sensual vices. The
lines about Ariphrades in the <i>Knights</i>, however, are an instance
of his having done this with more than the pungency of Martial,
and it must be admitted that his pictures of the drunkenness and
incontinence of the Athenian women have something Swiftish in
their brutal sarcasm. If we are to seek for an approximation to
Aristophanic humor, we shall find it perhaps in Rabelais. Rabelais
exhibits a similar disregard for decency, combining the same
depth of purpose and largeness of insight with the same coarse
fun. But in Aristophanes there is nothing quite grotesque and
homely, whereas Rabelais is full of these qualities. Even the
opening of the <i>Peace</i>, fantastic as it is in absurdity, does not touch
the note of grossness peculiar to French Pantagruelism. Aristophanes
is always Greek, while Rabelais inherits the medi&aelig;val spirit.
In reading Aristophanes we seem to have the serene skies of Attica
above our heads; the columns of the Propyl&aelig;a and the Parthenon
look down on us; noble shapes of youths and maidens are
crowding sacred marble steps; below, upon the mirror of the sea,
shine Salamis and &AElig;gina; and far off, in hazy distance, rise Peloponnesian
hills. With these pictures of the fancy his comedy
harmonizes. But Rabelais carries us away to Gothic courts and
monkish libraries; we fill his margin with etchings in the style of
Gustave Dor&eacute;. What has been said of Rabelais applies with even
greater force to Hogarth, whose absolute sincerity is as great as
that of Aristophanes, but who is never light and careless. His
coarseness is the product of a coarse nature, of coarse manners, of
a period of national co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>arseness. We tolerate it because of the
moral earnestness beneath: the artist is striving diligently to teach
us by warning us of vice. This is hardly ever the case with
Aristophanes. When he is coarse, we pardon him for very different
reasons. In his wilful degradation of humanity to the level
of animals we recognize a portion of the Weltvernichtungsidee.
In the intellectual arrogance of the Athenian prime a poet could
afford thus to turn the world upside down. But those who cannot
subscribe to the following dictum of Taine, which is very applicable
to Aristophanes&mdash;"Elev&eacute;es &agrave; cette &eacute;normit&eacute; et savour&eacute;es
avec cette insouciance, les fonctions corporelles deviennent po&eacute;tiques"&mdash;those
who</p>

<p>will need to "hurry amain" from the mask of moral anarchy
which the great comedian displays. With these remarks I may
finally dismiss what has to be said about the chief disability under
which Aristophanes labors as a poet.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>For the enjoyment of Aristophanic fun a sort of Southern childishness
and swiftness of gleeful apprehension is required. It does
not shine so much in its pure wit as in its overflowing humor and
in the inexhaustible fertility of ludicrous devices by which laughter
is excited. The ascent of Trugaios to heaven upon the dung-beetle's
back, and the hauling of Peace from her well in the <i>Eirene</i>,
or the wine-skin dressed up like a baby in the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>,
may be mentioned as instances of this broad but somewhat
peculiar drollery. Burlesquing the gods was always a capital resource
of the comic poets. If we in the nineteenth century can
find any amusement whatever in Byron's or Burnand's travesties
of Olympus, how exquisitely absurd to an Athenian mob must
have been the figures of Prometheus under an umbrella, Herakles
the glutton, Hermes and &AElig;acus the household slaves, Bacchus the
young fop, and Iris the soubrette. The puns of Aristophanes, for
the most part, are very bad, but the parodies are excellent. Then
the surprises (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#8055;&#945;&#957;), both of language and of incident,
with which his comedies abound, the broad and genial caricatures
which are so largely traced and carried out in detail with such
force, the brilliant descriptions of familiar things seen from odd
or unexpected points of view, and, lastly, the enormous quantity
of mirth-producing matter which the poet squanders with the
prodigality of conscious omnipotence, all contribute to heighten
the comic effect of Aristophanes. Perhaps the most intelligible
piece of fun, in the modern sense of the word, is the last scene
in the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>, which owes its effect to parody and
caricature more than to allusions which are hard to seize. A
great deal of the fun of Aristophanes must have depended upon
local and personal peculiarities which we cannot understand: the
constant references to the effeminate Cleisthenes, the skinflint
Pauson, miserly Patrocles, cowardly Cleonymus, Execestides the
alien, Agyrrhius the upstart, make us yawn because we cannot
catch the exact point of the jests against them. Indeed, as
Schlegel has said, "we may boldly affirm that, notwithstanding
all the explanations which have come down to us&mdash;notwithstanding
the accumulation of learning which has been spent upon it,
one half of the wit of Aristophanes is altogether lost to the
moderns."</p>

<p>Having dismissed these preliminary considerations, we may
now ask what has caused the comedy of Aristophanes to triumph
over the obstacles to its acceptance. Why have his plays been
transmitted to posterity when those of Eupolis and Cratinus have
perished, and when only scattered lines from the eight hundred
comedies of the middle period read by Athen&aelig;us have survived
destruction? No one has asked of Aristophanes the question
which the Alexandrian critic put to Menander: "Oh, Nature and
Menander, which of you copied the other?" Yet Menander is
scarcely more to us than the memory of departed greatness,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> or
at best an echo sounding somewhat faintly from the Roman theatre,
while Aristophanes survives among the most highly cherished
monuments of antiquity. The answer to this question is, no
doubt, that Aristophanes was more worth preservation than his
predecessors or successors. It is wiser to have confidence in the
ultimate good taste and conservative instinct of humanity than to
accept Bacon's half-ironical, half-irritable saying, that the stream
of time lets every solid substance sink, and carries down the froth
and scum upon its surface. As far, at least, as it is possible to
form a judgment, we may be pretty certain that in the province
of the highest art and of the deepest thought we possess the
greater portion of those works which the ancients themselves
prized highly; indeed, we may conjecture that had the great
libraries of Alexandria and Byzantium been transmitted to us
entire, the pure metal would not very greatly have exceeded in
bulk what we now possess, but would have been buried beneath
masses of inferior matter from which centuries would have scarcely
sufficed to disengage it. Aristophanes was preserved in his
integrity, we need not doubt, because he shone forth as a <i>poet</i>
transcendent for his splendor even among the most brilliant of
Attic playwrights. Cratinus may have equalled or surpassed him
in keen satire: Eupolis may have rivalled him in exquisite artistic
structure; but Aristophanes must have eclipsed them, not merely
by uniting their qualities successfully, but also by the exhibition
of some diviner quality, some higher spiritual afflatus. If we
analyze his art, we find that he combines the breadth of humor,
which I have already sought to characterize, with the utmost versatility
and force of intellect, with the power of grasping his subjects
under all their bearings, with extraordinary depth of masculine
good sense, with inexhaustible argumentative resources, and
with a marvellous hold on personalities. Yet all these qualities,
essential to a comic poet who pretended also to be the public
censor of politics and morals, would not have sufficed to immortalize
him had he not been essentially a poet&mdash;a poet in what we
are apt to call the modern sense of the word&mdash;a poet, that is to
say, endowed with original intuitions into nature, and with the
faculty of presenting to our minds the most varied thoughts and
feelings in language uniformly beautiful, as the creatures of an
exuberant and self-swayed fancy. Aristophanes is a poet as Shelley
or Ariosto or Shakespeare is a poet, far more than as Sophocles
or Pindar or Lucretius is a poet. In spite of his profound
art, we seem to hear him uttering "his native wood-notes wild."
The subordination of the fancy to the fixed aims of the reason,
which characterizes classical poetry, is not at first sight striking
in Aristophanes; but he splendidly exhibits the wealth, luxuriance,
variety, and subtlety of the fancy working with the reason, and
sometimes superseding it, which we recognize in the greatest
modern poets. If we seek to define the peculiar qualities of his
poetic power, we are led to results not easily expressed, because
all general critical conclusions are barren and devoid of force
when worded, but which may perhaps be stated and accepted as
the text for future illustration.</p>

<p>The poetry of Aristophanes is always swift and splendid. We
watch its brilliant course as we might watch the flight of a strong,
rapid bird, whose plumage glitters by moments in the light of
the sun; for, to insist upon the metaphor, the dazzling radiance
of his fancy only shines at intervals, capriciously, with fitful flashes,
coruscating suddenly and dying out again. It is as if the
neck alone and a portion of the feathers of the soaring bird were
flecked with gold and crimson grain, so that a turn of the body
or a fluttering of the pinions is enough to bring the partial splendor
into light or cast it into shadow. Aristophanes passes by
abrupt transitions from the coarsest or most simply witty dialogue
to passages of pure and plaintive song; he quits his fiercest
satire f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>or refreshing strains of lark-like heaven-aspiring melody.
These, again, he interrupts with sudden ruthlessness, breaking the
melody in the middle of a bar, and dropping the unfinished stanza.
He seems shy of giving his poetic impulse free rein, and prefers
to tantalize<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> us with imperfect specimens of what he might
achieve; so that his splendor is like that of northern streamers
in its lambency, though swift and piercing as forked lightnings
in its intensity. Even his most impassioned and sustained flights
of imagination are broken by digressions into satire, fantastic merriment,
or parody, by which the more dull-witted Athenians must
have been sorely puzzled in their inability to decide on the serious
or playful purpose of the poet. Perhaps the most splendid
passages of true poetry in Aristophanes are the choruses of the
initiated in the <i>Frogs</i>, the Chorus of the Clouds before they appear
upon the stage, the invitation to the nightingale, and the
parabasis of the Birds, the speech of Dikaios Logos in the <i>Clouds</i>,
some of the praises of rustic life in the <i>Peace</i>, the serenade (notwithstanding
its coarse satire) in the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i>, and the songs
of Spartan and Athenian maidens in the <i>Lysistrata</i>. The charm
of these marvellous lyrical episodes consists in their perfect simplicity
and freedom. They seem to be poured forth as "profuse
strains of unpremeditated art" from the fulness of the poet's soul.
Their language is elastic, changeful, finely tempered, fitting the
delicate thought like a veil of woven air. It has no Pindaric
involution, no &AElig;schylean pompousness, no studied Sophoclean
subtlety, no Euripidean <i>concetti</i>. It is always bright and Attic,
sparkling like the many-twinkling laughter of the breezy sea, or
like the light of morning upon rain-washed olive-branches. But
this poetry is never very deep or passionate. It cannot stir us
with the intensity of Sappho, with the fire and madness of the
highest inspiration. Indeed, the conditions of comedy precluded
Aristophanes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>even had he desired it, which we have no reason to
suspect, from attempting the more august movements of lyric poetry.
The peculiar glories of his style are its untutored beauties,
the improvised perfection and unerring exactitude of natural expression,
for which it is unparalleled by that of any other Greek
poet. In her most delightful moments the muse of Aristophanes
suggests an almost plaintive pathos, as if behind the comic
mask there were a thinking, feeling human soul, as if the very
uproar of the Bacchic merriment implied some after-thought of
sadness.</p>

<p>A detailed examination of the structure of the comedies would
be the best illustration of these remarks. At present it will be
enough to bring forward two examples of the tender melodies
which may at times be overheard in pauses of the wild Aristophanic
symphony. The first of these is the well-known Welcome
to the Nightingale, sung by the Chorus before their parabasis:</p>

all the birds are singing together, and that the wild throat of
their playfellow, the nightingale, is ready to return the welcome
with its throbbing song of May-time and young summer. Take

<p>"The violet-bed beside the well, and the olives which we long
to see again." Trugaios is reminding his fellow-villagers of the
pleasures of peace and of their country life. Those who from
their recollection of Southern scenery can summon up the picture,
who know how cool and shady are those wells, mirroring maidenhair
in their black depth; how fragrant and dewy are the beds
of tangled violets; how dreamy are the olive-trees, aerial, mistlike,
robed with light, will understand the peculiar &#960;&#8057;&#952;&#959;&#962; of these
lines.</p>

<p>But we mus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>t not dwell too much upon the glimpses of pathetic
poetry in Aristophanes, which, after all, are but few and far between,
mere swallow-flights of song, when compared with the serious
business of his art. It is well known that the old comedy
of the Athenians performed the function of a public censorship.
Starting from the primitive comic song, in which a rude Fescennine
license of what we now call "chaffing" was allowed, and
tempering its rustic jocularity with the caustic bitterness of Archilochian
satire, comedy became an instrument for holding up to
public ridicule all things of general interest. Persons and institutions,
nay, the gods themselves, are freely laughed at. Bacchus
seems to have enjoyed the jokes even when directed against himself:
&#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7988;&#963;&#969;&#962; &#967;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#953; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#8061;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#8036;&#957; are the words of
Lucian. So no one else had a right to resent the poet's merriment
when the presiding god of the festival approved of sarcasms
against his deity, and trod his own stage as a cowardly, effeminate
young profligate. This being the more serious aim of comedy, it
followed that Aristophanes always had some satiric, and in so far
didactic, purpose underlying his extravagant caricatures. What
that purpose was is too well known to need more than passing
mention. From his earliest appearance under the name of Callistratus,
to the last of his victories, Aristophanes maintained his
character as an Athenian Conservative. He came forward uniformly
as a panegyrist of the old policy of Athens, and a vehement
antagonist of the new direction taken by his nation subsequently
to the Persian war. This one theme he varied according
to circumstances and convenience. In the first of his plays&mdash;the
<i>Daitaleis</i>&mdash;he attacked the profligacy and immodesty of the rising
generation, who neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> their Homer for the lessons of the sophists,
and engaged in legal quarrels. The <i>Acharnians</i>, the <i>Peace</i>,
and the <i>Lysistrata</i> are devoted to impressing on the Athenians
the advantages of peace, and inducing them to lay aside their
enmity against Sparta. In the <i>Knights</i>, the demagogues are attacked
through the person of Cleon, with a violence of concentrated
passion that surpasses the most savage onslaughts of Archilochus.
The <i>Clouds</i> and <i>Wasps</i> exhibit different pictures of
the insane passion for litigation and the dishonest arts of rhetoric
which prevailed at Athens, fostered partly by the influence
of sophists who professed to teach a profitable method of public
speaking, and partly by the flattery of the demagogues. The
<i>Birds</i> is a fantastic satire upon the Athenian habit of building
castles in the air, and indulging in extravagant dreams of conquest.
In the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i> Aristophanes seems bent on ridiculing
the visionary Utopias of political theorists like Plato, and also on
caricaturing the social license which prevailed in Athens, where
everything, as he complains, had been tried, except for women to
appear in public like the men. In the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i> and the
<i>Frogs</i> we exchange politics for literature; but in his treatment
of the latter subject, Aristophanes exhibits the same conservative
spirit. His hostility against Euripides, which is almost as bitter
as his hatred of Cleon, is founded upon the sophistical nature of
his art. Indeed, the demagogues, the sophists, and Euripides
were looked upon by him as three forms of the same poison
which was corrupting the old &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; of his nation. We have now
indicated the serious intention of all the plays of Aristophanes
except the <i>Plutus</i>, which is an ethical allegory conceived under
a different inspiration from that which gave the impulse to his
other creative acts. Yet it must not be forgotten that the subject-matter
of these plays is often varied: in the <i>Acharnians</i>, for
example, we have a specimen of literary criticism, while the <i>Lysistrata</i>
is aimed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>s much at the follies of women as intended to
set forth the advantages of peace. We must also remember that
it was the poet's purpose to keep his serious ground-plan concealed.
His comedy had to be the direct antithesis to Greek
tragedy. If it taught, it was to teach by paradox. In this respect,
Aristophanes realized a very high ideal. Preach as he
may be doing in reality, and underneath his merriment there is
hardly a passage in all his plays, if we except the pleadings of
Dikaios Logos in the <i>Clouds</i>, and the personal portions of the
Parabases, in which we catch him revealing his own earnestness.
Every ordinary point of view is so consistently ignored, and all
the common relations of things are so thoroughly reversed, that
the topsy-turvy chaos which a play of Aristophanes presents is
quite harmonious. It is, in fact, madness methodized and with a
sober meaning. Perhaps we ought to seek in this consideration
the key to those problems which have occupied historians when
dealing with the Aristophanic criticism of Socrates. How, it is
always asked, could Aristophanes have been so consciously unjust
to the great moralist of Athens? If we keep in sight the intentional
absurdity of everything in one of the Aristophanic comedies,
we may perhaps understand how it was possible for the poet
to travesty the friend with whom he conversed familiarly at supper-parties.
That Plato understood the ridicule of his great master
from some such point of view as this is clear from his express
recommendation of the <i>Clouds</i> to Dionysius, from the portrait
which he draws of Aristophanes in the <i>Symposium</i>, and from the
eulogistic epigram (if that is genuine) which he composed upon
him. It is curious as a parallel that Aga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>thon should have been
even more ignobly caricatured than Socrates at the beginning of
the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>; yet we know from his own lips, as well
as from the dialogue of Plato, that Aristophanes was a friend of
the tragic poet, for he elsewhere calls him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8052;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lash applied to Socrates and Agathon is scarcely less stinging
than that applied to Cleon and Euripides. Yet the fact remains
that Aristophanes was the friend of Agathon and a member
of the Socratic circle. Much of the obscurity attending the
interpretation of the <i>Clouds</i> arises from our having lost the finer
<i>nuances</i> of Athenian feeling respecting the persons satirized in
the old comedy. <i>We</i> do not, for example, understand Cratinus
when he joins the name of Euripides with that of his great satirist
in one epithet descriptive of the quibbling style of the day&mdash;&#949;&#8016;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
But to return from this digression, we
may observe that it was only in a democracy that an institution
unsparing of friend an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>d foe, like the old comedy, in which persons
were openly exposed to censure and the solemn acts of the
government were called in question, could be tolerated. Accordingly
we find that the early development of comedy, after the
date of Susarion, was checked by the accession of Pisistratus to
power, and that the old comedy itself perished with the extinction
of Athenian liberty. It is only a democracy that likes to
criticise itself, that takes pride in its indifference to ridicule, and
in its readiness to acknowledge its own errors. In this respect,
we English are very democratic: we abuse ourselves and expose
our own follies more than any other nation; the press and the
platform do for us, in a barren, un&aelig;sthetic fashion, what Aristophanes
did for the Athenian public.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may now be able to see that a middle course must
be followed between the extremes of regarding Aristophanes as
an indecent parasite pandering to the worst inclinations of the
Athenian rabble, and of looking upon him as a profound philosopher
and sober patriot. The former view is maintained by
Grote, who, though he is somewhat hampered by his pronounced
championship of all the democratic institutions of Athens, among
which the comedy of Aristophanes must needs be reckoned, yet
clearly thinks that the poet was a meddling monkey, full indeed
of genius, but injurious to the order of the State and to the peace
of private persons. The latter has been advocated by the German
scholars Ranke, Bergk, and Meineke, against whom Grote
has directed an able and conclusive argument in the notes to his
eighth volume. Truly, it is absurd to pretend that Aristophanes
was the prudent and far-s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>eeing moralist described by his German
admirers. To imagine him thus would be to falsify the whole
purpose of the Athenian comic drama, and to test its large extravagance
by the narrow standard of modern morality. We
might as well fancy that Alexander was an unselfish worker in
the service of humanity as bring ourselves to see in Aristophanes
the sage of uniformly staid sobriety. Not to mention that such
a notion is at total variance with the only authentic portrait we
possess of him, in the <i>Symposium</i> of Plato, every line of his comedies
cries out against so pedantic and priggish a calumny. For
it is a calumny thus to misrepresent the high-spirited muse of
Aristophanes, with her dishevelled hair and Coan robe of flimsiest
gauze, and wild eyes swimming in the mists of wine. She never
pretends to be better than a priestess of the midnight Bacchus
and Corinthian Aphrodite, though she believes sincerely in the
inspiration of these deities. To see in her a Vestal or a Diotima,
to set the owl of Pallas on her shoulder, and to strap the &aelig;gis
round her panting breasts is a piece of elaborate stupidity and
painful impertinence which it remained for German pedagogues
to perpetrate. Yet it is equally wrong to think of Aristophanes
merely as a pernicious calumniator, who killed Socrates, and put
an ineffectual spoke in the wheel of progress. Granted that he
was more of a Merry-Andrew than a moralist, more of a &#947;&#949;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8056;&#962;
than a &#956;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8051;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#962;, we must surely be blind if we fail to
recognize the deep undernote of good sense and wisdom which
gives eternal value to his jests&mdash;worse than blind if we do not
honor him for valiant and unflinching service in the cause which
he had recognized as right. Nor are the enemies of Aristophanes
less insensible to his real merits as an artist than his ponderous
German friends. What are we to think of the imaginative faculties
of a man who, after gazing upon the divine splendors of the
genius of Aristophanes, after tracking the erratic flight of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>most radiant poet, "with his singing robes about him," can descend
to earth and wish that he had never existed, or shake his
head and measure him by the moral standards of Quarterly Reviews
and British respectability? Alas, that from the modern
world should have evanesced all appreciation of art that is not
obviously useful, palpably didactic! If we would rightly estimate
Aristophanic comedy, we must be prepared to accept it in the
classical spirit, and separating ourselves from either sect of the
Pharisees, refuse to picture its great poets to ourselves, on the
one hand as patriots <i>eximia morum gravitate</i>, or on the other as
foul slanderers and irreverent buffoons. Far beyond and outside
the plane of either standing-ground are they. The old comedy
of Athens is a work of art so tempered and so balanced that he
who would appreciate it must submit, for a moment at least, to
forego his modern advantages of improved morality and public
decency and purer taste and parliamentary courtesy, and to become&mdash;if
he can bend his moral back to that obliquity&mdash;a "merry
Greek."</p>

<p>It is now clear that Aristophanic comedy is in the history of
art unique&mdash;the product of peculiar and unrepeated circumstances.
The essential differences between it and modern comedy
are manifold. Modern comedy partakes of the tragic spirit;
it has a serious purpose, acknowledged by the poet; a lesson is
generally taught in its catastrophe; it is fond of poetical justice.
Aristophanic comedy, as we have seen, whatever may be its purpose,
is always ludicrous to the spectators and to itself. <i>Tartuffe</i>,
<i>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</i>, and <i>Volpone</i> are tragedies without
bloodshed: you only laugh at them incidentally. The <i>Clouds</i>,
the <i>Knights</i>, and the <i>Frogs</i> excite inevitable laughter. Nor is
this difference manifest only in the matter and spirit of the two
comedies: it expresses itself externally in their several forms.
The plays of Aristophanes, upon the stage, must have been like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
our pantomimes, or rather, like our operas. If we wish to form
a tolerable notion of the appearance of an Aristophanic comedy,
we cannot do better than keep in mind the <i>Flauto Magico</i> of
Mozart. Had Mozart received a good translation of the <i>Birds</i>
instead of the wretched libretto of the <i>Zauberfl&ouml;te</i>, what a really
magic drama he might have produced! Even as it is, with the
miserable materials he had to work upon, the master musician
has given us an Aristophanic specimen of the ludicrous passing
by abrupt but delicate transitions to the serious, of parody and
irony playing in and out at hide-and-seek, of pathos lurking beneath
merriment, and of madness leaping by a bound into the
regions of pure reason. And this he has achieved by the all-subduing
witchery of music&mdash;by melodies which solve the stiffest
contradictions, by the ebb and flow of measured sound rocking
upon its surface the most varied thoughts and feelings of the soul
of man. In the <i>Zauberfl&ouml;te</i> we are never surprised by any change,
however sudden&mdash;by any incident, however whimsical. After first
lamenting over the stupidity of the libretto, and then resigning
ourselves to the caprices of the fairy story, we are delighted to
follow the wanderings of music through her labyrinth of quaint
and contradictory absurdities. Just so, we fancy, must have been
the case with Aristophanes. Peisthet&aelig;rus and Euelpides were
not more discordant than Papageno; the Birds had their language
as Astrifiammante has hers; nor were the deeper tones of Aristophanic
meaning more out of place than the bass notes of Sarastro,
and the choruses of his attendant priests. Music, which has
harmonized the small and trivial contradictions of the <i>Zauberfl&ouml;te</i>,
harmonized the vast and profound contradictions of Aristophanic
comedy. It was the melodramatic setting of such plays as the
<i>Birds</i> and the <i>Clouds</i> which caused their Weltvernichtungsidee
to blossom forth melodiously into the magic tree, with all its
blossoms and nightingales and merry apes, to which I have so often
referred.</p>

<p>With this parallel between the <i>Birds</i> and an opera like the
<i>Zauberfl&ouml;te</i> in our minds, we may place ourselves among the thirty
thousand Athenian spectators assembled in the theatre about
the end of March, 414 B.C. We must remember that the great
expedition had recently gone forth to Sicily. It was only in the
preceding year that the Salaminian galley had been sent for Alcibiades,
who had escaped to Sparta, where he was now engaged i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>n
stirring up evil for his countrymen. But as yet no disaster had
befallen the army of invasion. Gylippus had not arrived. Lamachus
was still alive. Every vessel brought news to the Athenians
of the speed with which their forces were carrying on the work
of circumvallation, and of the despondency of the Syracusans.
The spectators of the plays of Aristophanes and Ameipsias were
nearly the same persons who had listened to the honeyed eloquence
of Alcibiades persuading them to undertake the expedition,
and promising them not merely the supremacy of Hellas,
but the empire of the Mediterranean and the subjugation of Carthage.
Alcibiades, indeed, had turned a traitor to his country;
but the charm of his oratory and the spirit he had roused remained.
Each father in the audience might fairly hope that his
son would share in raising Athens to her height of splendor: not
a man but felt puffed up with insolent prosperity. The only
warning voice which spoke while Athens trembled on the very
razor-edge of fortune was that of Aristophanes&mdash;but with how
sweet and delicate a satire, with sarcasms that had the sound of
flattery, with prognostications of failure that wore the shape of
realized ambitions, with musical banter and multitudinous jests
that seemed to apologize for folly rather than to censure it!
There is no doubt but that Aristophanes intended in the <i>Birds</i> to
ridicule the ambition of the Athenians and their inveterate gullibility.
Peisthet&aelig;rus and Euelpides represent in comic caricature
the projectors, agitators, schemers, flatterers, who, led by Alcibiades,
had imposed upon the excitable vanity of the nation. Cloud-cuckootown
is any castle in the air or South Sea bubble which
might take the fancy of the Athenian mob. But it is also more
especially the project of Western dominion connected with their
scheme of Sicilian conques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>t. Aristophanes has treated his theme
so poetically and largely that the interests of the <i>Birds</i> is not,
like that of the <i>Wasps</i> or the <i>Knights</i>, almost wholly confined to
the Athens of his day. It transcends those limitations of place
and time, and is the everlasting allegory of foolish schemes and
flimsy ambition. A modern dramatist&mdash;Ben Jonson or Moli&egrave;re,
for instance, perhaps even Shakespeare&mdash;could hardly have refrained
from ending the allegory with some piece of poetical justice.
We should have seen Peisthet&aelig;rus disgraced and Cloud-cuckootown
resolved into "such stuff as dreams are made of."
But this is not the art of Aristophanes. He brings Peisthet&aelig;rus
to a successful catastrophe, and ends his comedy with marriage
songs of triumph. Yet none the less pointed is the satire. The
unreality of the vision is carefully maintained, and Peisthet&aelig;rus
walking home with Basileia for his bride, like some new sun-eclipsing
star, seems to wink and strut and shrug his shoulders,
conscious of the Titanic sham.</p>

<p>To analyze in detail a work of art so well known to all students
as the <i>Birds</i> would be needless. It is enough to notice in
passing that it is quite unique of its kind, combining, as it does,
such airy fancies as we find in the <i>Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>
with the peculiar pungency of Aristophanic satire, untainted by
the obscenity which forms an integral part of the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i> or
<i>Lysistrata</i>. Most exquisite is the art with which Aristophanes
has collected all the facts of ornithology, all the legends and folklore
connected with birds, so as to create a fanciful birdland and
atmosphere of true bird life for his imaginary beings. Not less
wonderful is the imagination with which he has conceived the
whole universe from the bird's point of view, his sympathy with
the nightingale, the drollery of his running footman Trochilus,
the pompous gravity of his King Epops, and so on through the
whole of his winged <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. The tri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>umph of his art
is the Parabasis, in which the birds pour forth melodious compassion
for the transitory earth-born creatures of an hour. Poor
men, with their little groping lives! The epithets of pity which
the happier birds invent to describe man are woven, as it were, of
gossamer and dew, symbols of fragility. Then the music changes
as the vision of winged Eros, up-soaring from the primeval windegg,
bursts upon the fancy of the Chorus. Again it subsides into
still more delicate irony, when the just reign of the birds on earth
and over heaven is prophesied; and the whole concludes with
semichorus answering to semichorus in antiphonal strains of
woodland poetry and satire&mdash;the sweet notes of the flute responded
to by shouts of Bacchic laughter.</p>

<p>We have seen in dealing with the <i>Birds</i> how Aristophanes converted
the whole world into a transcendental birdland, and filled
his play with airy shapes and frail imaginings. This power of
alchemizing and transmuting everything he touches into the substance
of his thought of the moment is no less remarkable in the
comedy of the <i>Clouds</i>. And here we are able to mark the peculiar
nature of his allegory more clearly than in the choruses of
the <i>Birds</i>, with greater accuracy to distinguish the play of pure
poetry alternating with satire, to trace the glittering thread of
fancy drawn athwart the more fantastic arabesque of comic caricature.
In the <i>Clouds</i> Aristophanes ridicules the rising school
of teachers who professed to train the youth of Athens in the
arts of public speaking and successful litigation. He aims at the
tribe of sophists, who substituted logical discussion for the old
&aelig;sthetic education of the Greeks, and who sought to replace
mythological religion by meteorological explanations of natural
phenomena. The pedantry of this dialectic in its boyhood offended
the artistic sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>se of a conservative like Aristophanes: the
priggishness of upstart science had the air to him of insolent irreligion.
Besides he saw that this new philosophy, while it undermined
the &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; of his nation, was capable of lending itself to
ignoble ends&mdash;that its possessors sought to make money, that
their disciples were eager to acquire mere technical proficiency, in
order to cut a fine figure in public and to gain their selfish purposes.
The sophists professed two chief subjects: &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8051;&#969;&#961;&#945;, or
the science of natural phenomena; and rhetoric, or the art of
conquering by argument. Aristophanes, in the <i>Clouds</i>, satirizes
both under the form of allegory by bringing upon the stage his
Chorus of Clouds, who, in their changeful shapes&mdash;heaven-obscuring,
appearing variously to various eyes, coming into being from
the nothing of the air, and passing away again by imperceptible
dissolution, usurping upon the functions of Zeus in the thunder
and the rain, hurrying hither and thither at the will of no divine
force, but impelled by the newly discovered abstraction Vortex&mdash;are
the very forms and symbols of the airy, misty Proteus of verbal
falseness and intangible irreligion which had begun to possess
the Athenians. In order to understand the force of this allegory,
we must remember the part which the clouds played in the still
vital mythology of the Greeks. It was by a cloud that Hera in
her divine scorn had deluded the impious desires of Ixion, who,
embracing hollow shapes of vapor, begat Centaurs. The rebellious
giants who sought to climb Olympus were forms of mist
and tempest invading the serenity of highest heaven: this Strepsiades
indicates when he quotes the wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>ds &#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#952;' &#7953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#954;&#949;&#966;&#8049;&#955;&#945; &#932;&#965;&#966;&#8182;
as referring to the clouds. It was in cloudy vision
that gods appeared to mortals or escaped their sight; in cloud
that the Homeric heroes were snatched from death by their Olympian
patrons; in clouds that &AElig;olus dwelt and Dana&euml; was prisoned.
The Harpies were wind-tossed films of frothy cloud; the
Sirens daughters of foam and mist. Everything that deceived
and concealed, that shifted and eluded, that stole away "the enchanted
gazer's mind," all Maya or delusion, all fascination and
unrealizable desire, was symbolized by clouds. Nor was it without
meaning that the clouds ascended from Ocean, from the wily
parent of wave and storm, the inscrutable hoarder of secrets
locked within the caverns of the murmuring deep, who might
never be taken in any one clear form, who loved to cozen and betray,
whose anger was swift and fretful against such as caught
him in their toils. The clouds were his daughters, and so was
Aphrodite&mdash;beautiful, deceitful, soul-subduing&mdash;these his offspring
of the air, this his child of the foam&mdash;these pouring glamour on
the eyes of men, this folding their hearts in snares. Without being
fanciful, we might follow this analysis through a hundred
labyrinths, all tending to show how exquisite to the apprehension
of a Greek steeped in mythological associations must have been
the allegory of the clouds. We might, moreover, have pointed
out the care of Aristophanes to maintain this mythological propriety.
Even in the Parabasis, for instance, where the Chorus
comes forward in its human character as the representative of the
poet, there occurs a semi-choric strain of great beauty, hymning
the elemental deities of Sun, Air, Ocean, and all-covering Heaven,
who are the parents and especial patrons of the clouds; for the
Sun begets them from the fountains of the Sea, the Air receives
and gives them shape as they drift through her yielding realm,
and the gr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>eat Zeus of the sky compels them to his service, stores
them with his thunder, and makes a palace for them in his adamantine
home, and wreathes their dances round his footstool of
the firmament. But it is enough to have pointed out the main
features of the allegory. The scope which it afforded for the display
of splendid poetry was of course immense. From the first moment
of the appearance of the Chorus to the end we never lose sight
of their cloudy splendor, and, as in the case of the <i>Birds</i>, every
thought, playful or imaginative, which can be conceived relating
to the world of clouds, is pressed by Aristophanes into his service.</p>

<p>Early in the play the fount of poetry which they suggest springs
pure and clear from the flinty rock of previous satire. Socrates,
who has just been displayed to us as the insignificant anatomizer
of fleas and gnats, rises suddenly to this height in his invocation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O Sovereign King, immeasurable Air, who keepest the earth balanced, and
blazing Ether, and sublime goddesses, ye Clouds of lightning and of thunder,
arise, appear, dread queens, in mid-air to your Thinker!"</p></div>

<p>It is only in the last word, notice, that the comic smile breaks out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Come, then, ye reverend Clouds, honor this neophyte with your dread
beauty! whether upon Olympus's holy snow-swept peaks ye sit, or in the gardens
of father Ocean weave the dance with nymphs, or in golden pitchers
draw the waters of Nile, or in M&aelig;otis bide, or on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>the white eyries of Mimas:
listen, receive our sacrifice, be gracious to our rites."</p></div>

<p>With what radiance of imagination the haunts of the clouds are
here enumerated! Sometimes we see them floating in virginal
processions above unfooted snows, sometimes enthroned like
queens in solemn silence on aerial watch-towers, sometimes dissolved
in dew far down among the Oceanides, or brooding, filmy
vapors, on the face of broad untroubled lakes.</p>

<p>Aristophanes, it may be said in passing, never dwells upon the
more tempestuous functions of the clouds as stormy and angry
powers: that would be to violate his allegory, which must always
show them deceitfully beautiful, spreading illusion over earth and
sky.</p>

<p>In answer to the invitation of Socrates, the Clouds are heard
behind the stage chanting a choric hymn;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and here it must be
remarked that the poet has revealed subtle instinct, for before exhibiting
his Chorus, arrayed in veils of filmy gauze, to the people,
by which he might have risked the possibility of exciting ludicrous
instead of solemn ideas, he enlists the imagination of the
audience by a sublime strain of preparatory music, vocally realizing
the splendor of the coming Clouds before they strike the eyes
of the spectators.</p>

<p>It is to the repeated roll of distant thunder that they sing their
untranslatable entrance hymn. Behold them rising, silent domes
and pinnacles and towers, from the burnished mirror of the noonday
sea: how the sunlight flashes on their pearly slopes and fills
their deeply cloven valleys: how dewy bright and glistening they
are! Then watch them scale the vault of heaven, quitti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ng the
horizon with its mists, marching in tranquil state across the spaces
of blue ether, gliding to their thrones among the mountain pines!
There they repose, and at their feet is heard the clamor of the
streams, the deep rebounding boom of sea waves; but they are
seated in serenity, and below them lies the champaign with its
fruits of holy earth, and on their broad immortal marble fronts
the unwearied light of the sun-god plays. From their girdles to
their sandals falls the robe of mist that wrapped them round, and
on the watch-towers of the world they sit, bare in their beauty,
godlike forms.</p>

<p>Such is the vision which this inimitable Chorus evokes. Its
truth has been felt by all who have seen the rising of summer
clouds from the waters of the Mediterranean. Indeed, this Chorus
belongs to the highest order of poetry. Not only does it furnish
an example of the freshness which is peculiar to Aristophanes, but
it is in the deepest sense an intuition into the inmost life of nature.
We hear in it the voice of a true seer or interpreter, who
knows by choice of words and rhythms how to convey his own
impressions to our mind. Even Shelley, when he wrote his <i>Cloud</i>,
had grasped perhaps the secret of the pomp and splendor of cloudland
less firmly than Aristophanes has done, though his images
are piled so multitudinously, and every thought or fancy that a
cloud suggests is whirled, as it were, in the drift of brilliant and
radiant shapes. Aristophanes has this advantage&mdash;that something
of the mythop&#339;ic power still survived in Greece, and that he
shared the sculptural genius of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>his race. Moreover, his audience
were prepared by their religious associations to conceive of his
Clouds as living creatures, and he was writing for the stage, where
the poetry of personification is made easy by direct appeal to the
eyesight.</p>

<p>In the <i>Clouds</i> as it has been transmitted to us, Aristophanes
employs another and more direct form of allegory. He brings
upon the stage the &#948;&#8055;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; in controversy with the &#7940;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;
&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;&mdash;the former representing the old conservative education of
Athens; the other the new theories and modes of life which were
beginning to spring up. It has been conjectured that &#948;&#8055;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;
&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; wore the mask of Aristophanes himself, and &#7940;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;
that of Thrasymachus the sophist. If this conjecture hits the
truth, it is curious that the vulgar logician whom Socrates handles
so severely in Plato's <i>Republic</i> should have been chosen as the
ideal of his doctrine and influence&mdash;the special pleader of the
Phrontisterion. The contest between these two impersonations
of modesty and impudence, of manliness and effeminacy, offers
a unique example in Greek comic literature of what was common
on our own stage about three centuries ago. The Just and
Unjust Logoi dispute and wrangle for the favor of Pheidippides
precisely like the abstractions in <i>Hycke Scorner</i> or <i>Lusty Juventus</i>.
Of course this kind of allegory is much coarser and affords less
scope for poetical treatment than the exquisite mythus of the
<i>Clouds</i>. The Logoi are but masks or hollow automata, from behind
which the poet utters his arguments: there is no illusion of
the senses, no enchantment of the fancy in their presentation.
Yet the speech of Dikaios Logos forms one of the purest and
most beautiful passages that Aristophanes has written, in its simple
and affectionate picture of old <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>Athenian life. The poet, we
fear, was very far behind his age: he looked back to the good
times when the sailor only knew enough to sing out "Ahoy!"
and call for biscuit: he wanted the Athenian lads to have broad
backs and sluggish tongues: he was dead to the advantages of
dialectic and Socratic definition: he kept trying to bring back the
days of Marathon, when nothing could avert the coming days of
Syracuse and &AElig;gospotami and Ch&aelig;ronea. We who read the history
of Athens by the light of our Grote, we who are rolling our
waves towards the rising instead of the setting sun, know now
how very perverse and un-advanced the poet was. Yet, for all
that, can we fail to be charmed with the picture that he draws of
Greek boyhood in the good old times, and to contrast it favorably
with the acknowledged impudence and profligacy of Critias
and Agathon and Alcibiades&mdash;the friends and pupils of Socrates?
"In that blissful time," says Dikaios Logos, "when I flourished,
and modesty and temperance were practised, a boy's voice
was never heard; but he would set off at daybreak, in snow or
sunshine, with his comrades to the school of the harper, where he
learned the ballads of our forefathers in praise of Pallas; and
from the harper he would run to the training-ground and exercise
himself with the decorum befitting virtuous youth." The rules
for the behavior of boys which Aristophanes here enunciates provoke
a modern smile; for the morality of Athens obliged lads to
observe the same sort of propriety which we expect from girls.
But for all his modesty, the youth of those days was not a milksop.
He did indeed shun the public baths and the agora, repel
the advances of profligate persons, respect his parents, avoid Hetairai,
and form in his breast an image of Aidos; yet he frequented
the wrestling-ground, and grew fair in f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>orm and color
with generous exercises, not "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought," nor bent and jaded by the restless wrangling of the law
courts; but among the sacred olive-trees of the Academy he ran
races with his comrade, "crowned with white reeds, smelling of
bindweed and careless hours and leaf-shedding poplar, rejoicing
in the prime of spring, when the plane-tree whispers to the elm."
In these last lines we touch the very core of Greek aristocratic
conservatism&mdash;that imperious demand for leisure, for &#963;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#8052; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#8055;&#969;&#957;, of which Aristotle speaks as an essential in the life of
free men; that contempt of all serious time-consuming business
which we find in Plato; that respect for the beauty of the body,
and that dislike of every occupation that tended to degrade its
form or spoil the freshness of its color; that sympathy with nature
in her graceful moods; that well-bred nonchalance; that love
of the gymnasium with its poplar sacred to Herakles, the god of
endurance, and its plane-tree of swift Hermes&mdash;in a word, those
accumulated &aelig;sthetical prejudices which marked the race pre-eminent
for its artistic faculty, the caste of rich and idle citizens supported
by a nation of slaves, the unique and never-again-to-be-imitated
people, who once and for all upon this earth of ours
attained perfection, realized the ideal towards which we vainly
strive.</p>

<p>With the last lines of this speech in our memory, we may turn
to the dialogues of Plato, whose Ph&aelig;drus and Charmides and
Lysis are true children and disciples of Dikaios Logos; or to the
Autolycus of Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i>, whose breast is as smooth,
and skin as bright, and shoulders as broad, and tongue as short,
as even Aristophanes could wish; or we may set before us some
statue like the Apoxyomenos of Lysippus, or the Discobolos of
Myron, and feel that we have gathered, in fancy at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> the
flower of the perfection of the pride of Hellas.</p>

<p>Much of the allegory of Aristophanes consists of metaphors
taken literally and expressed by appropriate symbolism to the
audience. Thus, Trugaios actually drags the goddess Peace, with
her attendants Opora and Theoria, from the well, the Chorus,
while they help him, singing "Yoho!" like sailors at a capstan.
In the same comedy, War and Havoc are exhibited with a gigantic
mortar, in which they bray the States of Greece. Socrates
suspended in his basket is a metaphorical allegory of this sort, his
posture being peculiarly expressive of star-gazing and abstract
speculation at a time when the objects of such contemplations
were called &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8051;&#969;&#961;&#945;. Of the same kind is the balance in which
the lines of &AElig;schylus and Euripides are weighed. Any poet
might use the metaphor (weighed in the balance and found wanting);
but it is a stretch of metaphorical license to exhibit an actual
pair of scales upon the stage. Many of the figurative actions
of the Hebrew prophets were practical appeals to the imagination,
similar to these allegories of Aristophanes. Indeed, such
dramatic metaphors may be reckoned among the most powerful
instruments in the hands of a great master. Had Dante conceived
a mask upon the politics of Italy, we doubt not but that
he would have employed some energetic symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>s of this sort; and,
in passing, it may be said that no artist has appeared in modern
times so capable of constructing an allegorical drama in the style
of Aristophanes as Dante. The symbolism of the <i>Wasps</i> is somewhat
different from that with which we have been dealing. In
this play the Chorus were armed, no doubt, with lance-like stings;
but there was no attempt on the poet's part, as in the case of the
<i>Clouds</i> and <i>Birds</i>, to maintain the illusion of their being wasps.
They talk and act like old men; their waspishness is merely metaphorical,
and the allegory ends in an appeal to the eyesight.
The <i>Plutus</i>, on the other hand, presents an example of allegory
in the strictly modern sense. It is a Greek anticipation of our
moralities, of such a play as might be founded on a portion of the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. Wealth and Poverty appear upon the stage,
and speak appropriately. Avarice and Prodigality are satirized.
The use and abuse of riches are contrasted in a series of incidents
framed with expressly moral purpose. The whole play is singularly
un-Aristophanic. We have here no "Weltvernichtungsidee"&mdash;no
nightingales or climbing apes to speak of. For this very
reason it has been copied in modern times (its inner nature rendering
it capable of adaptation to our tastes) by Ben Jonson in
the <i>Staple of News</i>, and by Goethe in the second part of <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>One word must be devoted to the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>. In the
history of dramatic literature, the chief interest of the play is that
it differs from the other works of Aristophanes in its structure.
It has a regular plot&mdash;an intrigue and a solution&mdash;and its persons
are not allegorical, but real. Thus it approaches the standard of
modern comedy. But the plot, though gigantic in its scale, and
prodigious in its wealth of wit and satire, is farcical. The artifices
by which Euripides endeavors to win Agathon to undertake
his cause, the disguise of Mnesilochus in female attire, the oratory
of the old man against the women in the midst of their assembly,
his detection, the momentary suspension of the dramatic action
by his seizure of the supposed baby, his slaughter of the swaddled
wine-jar, his apprehension by Cleisthenes, the devices and disguises
by which Euripides (in parody of his own tragic scenes)
endeavors to extricate his father-in-law from the scrape, and the
final ruse by which he eludes the Scythian bowmen, and carries
off Mnesilochus in triumph&mdash;all these form a series of highly diverting
comic scenes. There is no passage in Aristophanes more
amusing than the harangue of Mnesilochus. The other women
have abused Euripides for slandering their sex in his tragedies.
Mnesilochus, the humorous and coarse old rustic, gets up in his
flimsy female gear, and eloquently reminds them of the truths
which Euripides <i>might</i> have divulged. One crime after another
is glibly and facetiously recorded, until the little heap of calumnies
uttered by Euripides disappears beneath the mountain of confessions
piled up by the supposed matron. The portrait, too, of
Agathon in the act of composition is exquisitely comic. By comparing
it with that drawn by Plato in the <i>Banquet</i>, we may to
some extent estimate the amount of truth in Aristophanic caricature.
The meaningless melodious style&mdash;the stream of honeyed
words,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> <i>summa delumbe saliva</i>&mdash;with which Agathon and his
Chorus greet our ears is scarcely more a parody of his poetry
than the speech on love is of his prose. Agathon is discovered
lying on a sofa, arrayed in female garments and smelling of cosmetics;
when asked why thus attired, he lisps a languid answer
that he is composing a tragedy about women, and wants to be in
character:</p>

<p>Modern writers upon whose lips <i>in udo est M&aelig;nas et Attis</i>
might take some of this satire not inaptly to themselves. But
the crowning sport of the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i> is in the last scene,
when Mnesilochus adapts the <i>Palamedes</i> and the <i>Helen</i> of Euripides
to his own forlorn condition, jumbling up the well-known
verses of these tragedies with coarse-flavored rustical remarks;
and when at last Euripides himself acts Echo and Perseus to the
Andromeda of his father-in-law, and both together mystify the policeman
by their ludicrous utterance of antiphonal lamentations.</p>

<p>I have but scanty space for touching on one of the topics which
the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i> suggests&mdash;the satire of Aristophanes upon
Athenian women, whom he invariably represents as profligate, licentious,
stupid, drunken, thieves, and liars. Whether they were
in any sense as bad as he has painted them&mdash;and he has given
them a worse character than any other Greek poet, not even excepting
Simonides of Amorgos&mdash;or whether their absence from
the comic spectacles encouraged a paradoxical misrepresentation
of their worst and most exceptional qualities, is not easy to decide.
This at least is clear that, while comic exaggeration is obvious
in every detail, the picture, overdrawn and coarse as it may
be, accords with that of other and less copious Greek satirists;
nor could it have been tolerated in a society where women held a
station of respect and honor.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The point of the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>, so far as the women are
concerned, is that while Aristophanes pretends to show up Euripides
for his abuse of them, his own satire is far more searching,
and penet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>rates more deeply into the secrets of domestic life.
What are the crimes of Ph&aelig;dra in comparison with the habits
he imputes to Athenian wives and daughters? The <i>Lysistrata</i>
will not bear discussion; but in passing I may notice the humor
of the oath by wine which the inexorable heroine and her Spartan
friend administer. Other oaths might be broken, but no Athenian
wife or maid would incur the penalty of this dread imprecation:
"If I fail, may the bowl be filled with water." Of the three
comedies which treat of women, the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i> has the most
permanent interest. Indeed, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, its satire might
almost be adapted to the present day, or to the future which our
theorists upon the rights of women are preparing. The Athenian
ladies disguise themselves as men, and crowd the assembly, where
they outvote their husbands, sons, and brothers, and proclaim the
supremacy of women in the State. Praxagora, the agitator of the
scheme, is chosen strategis. She decides that a community of
property and free-trade between the sexes are the two things
wanted to insure general felicity. The point of the satire consists
in this: that the arguments by which the women get the
upper-hand all turn on their avowed conservatism; men change
and shift, women preserve their old customs, and will maintain
the &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; of the State; but no sooner have they got authority
than they show themselves more democratic than the demagogues,
more new-fangled in their political notions than the philosophers.
They upset time-honored institutions and make new
ones to suit their own caprices, squaring the laws according to
the logic of feminine instincts. Of course speculations like those
of Plato's <i>Republic</i> are satirized in the farcical scenes which illustrate
the consequences of this female revolution. But perhaps
the finest point about the comedy is its humorous insight into
the workings of women's minds&mdash;its clear sense of what a topsy-tu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>rvy
world we should have to live in if women were the lawgivers
and governors.</p>

<p>In quitting Aristophanes I am forced to reflect upon the inadequacy
of my attempts to interpret the secret of his strength and
charm. The epithets which continually rise to our lips in speaking
of him&mdash;radiant, resplendent, swift, keen, changeful, flashing,
magical&mdash;carry no real notion of the marvellous and subtle spirit,
that animates his comedy with life peculiar to itself. In dealing
with no other poet is the critic or historian so powerless. No
other work of art leaves so incommunicable an impression on
the mind of the student. As for my words about Aristophanes,
they are "sound and fury signifying nothing:" to be known, he
must be read with admiration and delight. But those who have
submitted themselves to the influence of his genius will understand
what I mean when, in conclusion, I say that, with Plato and
Aristophanes for guides, we can to some extent reconstruct the
life of the Athenians, animate the statues of Myron and Lysippus,
and see the aisles of the Parthenon or the benches of the
Pnyx crowded with real human beings. Plato introduces us to
the graver and more elegant side of Attic life, to the &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8054;
and &#967;&#945;&#961;&#8055;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, to men of sober tastes and good birth and exquisite
breeding. Aristophanes acquaints us with men of pleasure, vulgar
and uneducated characters, haunters of the law courts and the
market-place and the assembly. From Plato we learn what occupied
philosophers and people of distinction. Aristophanes tells
us the popular jokes at Athens, how the political and military
edicts recorded by Thucydides were familiarly discussed, how
people slept and walked and dressed and dined. In Plato's Dialogues
the fine Greek intellect is shown to us trained and tutored
into exquisite forms of elevated culture. In Aristophanes, though
art even more consummate has been used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>, we see the same refined
intellect running riot and disporting itself with the flexibility of
untamable youth. By Plato we are taught how dignified and
humane the Greeks could be, by Aristophanes how versatile and
human they were.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> One of the most interesting chapters in Greek history still remains to be
written. It should deal in detail with the legal and domestic position of free
women at Athens, with the relation of their sons and husbands to Hetairai,
and with the whole associated subject of paiderastia. Since this essay on
Aristophanes was first published, Mr. Mahaffy has done much in his excellent
book on <i>Social Life in Greece</i> towards clearing up our views upon these
matters. But the topic still requires a fuller and more scientific handling.
Mr. Mahaffy is particularly felicitous in marking the distinctions of the Herodotean,
Thucydidean, and Euripidean estimates of women, in bringing into
prominence the <i>&#338;conomicus</i> of Xenophon, and in laying stress upon the warfare
of opinion which raged at Athens between conservatives of the Periclean
tradition, represented by Aristophanes, and innovators, represented in poetry
by Euripides, in philosophy by Plato. I cordially agree with him in his remark
that "in estimating women at this time, the Alcestis and Macaria of
Euripides are too high, and the women of Aristophanes are too low" (<i>Social
Greece</i>, 2d ed. p. 228). The great difficulty which m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>ust have been felt by all
thoughtful students of Greek literature is how to reconcile the high ideals
of female character presented by the Attic tragedians with the contemptuous
silence of Thucydides, with the verdict of Plato upon women-lovers as
compared with boy-lovers, with the ribaldry allowed to comic poets, and with
the comparative absence of female portraits in the biographies of great
Athenians composed by Plutarch.</p></div></div>

<p>The two centuries during which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>comedy flourished at Athens
may be divided into three marked periods of national and political
existence. Between 448 and 404 B.C., under the Periclean
administration and until the end of the Peloponnesian war, the
Demos continued through all vicissitudes conscious of sovereignty
and capable of indefinite expansion. Then came the dismantlement
of Athens by Lysander and the dismemberment of the old
democracy. From 404 to 338 B.C., Athens, though humbled
to the rank of a second-class State, and confused in foreign and
domestic policy, retained her freedom, and exercised an important
influence over the affairs of Hellas. She no longer, however, felt
within herself the force of youth, the ambition of conquest, or
the pride of popular autocracy. Her intellectual activity was
turned from political and constitutional questions inwards to philosophy
and literature. From 338 to about 260 B.C. this metamorphosis
of the nation was carried further and accomplished. Athens
ceased to be a city of statesmen and orators, and became the
capital of learning. She was no longer in any true sense free or
powerful, though populous and wealthy and frequented by cultivated
men of all nations. Not only had public interest declined,
but the first fervor for philosophy was past. A <i>modus vivendi</i>
suited to a tranquil, easy, pleasure-loving people, who rejoiced in
leisure and combined refined amusements with luxury, had been
systematized in the Epicurean view of life. To accept the conditions
of existence and to make the best of them, to look on like
spectators at the game of the world, and to raise no troublesome
insoluble questions, was the ideal of this period. Fifty years after
the last date mentioned, the Romans set their foot on Hellas,
and Greek culture began to propagate itself with altered forms in
Italy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>To these three periods in the national existence of Athens the
three phases through which comedy passed correspond with almost
absolute accuracy. Emerging from the coarse Megarian
farces and the phallic pageants of the Dionysian Komos, the old
comedy, as illustrated by Aristophanes, allowed itself the utmost
license. It incarnated the freedom of democracy, caricaturing individuals,
criticising constitutional changes, and, through all its
extravagances of burlesque and fancy, maintaining a direct relation
to politics. Only a nation in the plenitude of self-contentment,
conscious of vigor and satisfied with its own energy, could
have tolerated the kind of censorship these comic poets dared to
exercise. The glaring light cast by Aristophanes upon abuses in
the State reminded his audience of the greatness and the goodness
that subsisted with so much of mean and bad. From their
high standpoint of security they could afford, as they imagined,
to laugh, and to enjoy a spectacle that travestied their imperfections.
At the same time an undercurrent of antagonism to the
Aristophanic comedy made itself felt from time to time. Laws
were passed prohibiting this species of the drama in general (&#956;&#8052;
&#954;&#969;&#956;&#8179;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957;), or restricting its personality (&#956;&#8052; &#954;&#969;&#956;&#8179;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8055;), or
prohibiting the graver functionaries of the State from exhibiting
comic plays. These laws, passed, abrogated, and repassed between
440 and 404 B.C., mark the ebb and flow of democratic
liberty. After the humiliation of Athens at the close of the Peloponnesian
war, the political subject-matter of the old comedy
was withdrawn, and the attitude of the audience was so altered
as to render its peculiar censorship intolerable. Meanwhile, the
speculative pursuits to which the Athenians since the days of the
sophists had addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>cted themselves began to tell upon the character
of the nation, now ripe for the second or literary stage of comedy.
The poets of this period had not yet arrived at the comedy
of manners which presents a close and faithful picture of domestic
life. They directed their wit and humor against classes rather
than characters. Philosophers and poets, parasites and het&aelig;r&aelig;,
took the place of the politicians. Nor did they abandon the
old art-form of Attic comedy, for it is clear that the Chorus still
played an important part in their plays. At the same time, in
comedy as in tragedy, the Chorus came to be less and less an integral
part of the drama; and while more attention was paid to
plot and story, the grotesque allegories of the first period were
dropped. The transition from the old to the middle comedy is
signalized by the <i>Frogs</i> of Aristophanes, which, maintaining the
peculiar character of the elder form of art, relinquished politics
for literature. The new comedy, known to us through the fragments
of Menander and the Latin imitations, abandoned the Chorus
altogether, and produced a form of art corresponding to what
we know as the comedy of character and manners in the modern
world. Interest was concentrated on the fable, and the skill of
the poet was displayed in accurate delineations of domestic scenes.
The plot seems to have almost invariably turned on love-adventures.
Certain fixed types of character&mdash;the parasite, the pimp,
the roguish servant, the severe father, the professional captain, the
spendthrift son, the unfortunate heroine, and the wily prostitute&mdash;appeared
over and over again. To vary the presentation of
these familiar persons taxed the ingenuity of the playwright, as
afterwards in Italy and France, during the tyranny of pantaloon
and matamore, Leandre and prima amorosa.</p>

<p>Traged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>y and comedy, though they began so differently, had
been gradually approximating to one type, so that between Menander
and the latest followers of Euripides there was scarcely
any distinction of form and but little difference of subject-matter.
The same sententious reflection upon life seasoned both
species of the drama. The religious content of the elder tragedy
and the broad burlesque of the elder comedy alike gave place to
equable philosophy. The tragic climax was sad; the comic climax
gay: more license was allowed in the comic than in the tragic
iambic: comedy remained nearer to real life and therefore more
interesting than tragedy. Such, broadly speaking, were the limits
of their differences now. In this approximation toward artistic
similarity comedy rather than tragedy was a gainer. It is
clear that the Aristophanic comedy could not have become permanent.
To dissociate it from the peculiar conditions of the
Athenian democracy was impossible. Therefore the process by
which the old comedy passed into the middle, and the middle
into the new, must be regarded as a progression from the local
and the accidental to the necessary and the universal. The splendor
that may seem to have been sacrificed belonged less to the
old comedy itself than to the genius of Aristophanes, who succeeded
in engrafting the most brilliant poetry upon the rough
stock of the Attic farce. Tragedy, on the contrary, lost all when
she descended from the vantage-ground of &AElig;schylus. It must
not, however, be imagined that the change in either case depended
upon chance. It was necessitated by the internal transmutation
of the Athenians into a nation of students, and by the corresponding
loss of spontaneity in art. For the full development of
the comedy of manners a critical temper in the poet and the audience,
complexity of social customs, and inclination to r<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>eflect upon
them, together with maturity of judgment, were required. These
conditions, favorable to art which seeks its motives in a spirit of
tolerant, if somewhat cynical, philosophy, but prejudicial to the
highest serious poetry, account for the decline of tragedy and the
contemporaneous ascent of comedy in the fourth century B.C.
The comedy of Menander must therefore be considered as an advance
upon that of Cratinus, though it is true that this comedy is
the art of refined and senescent, rather than of vigorous and adolescent,
civilization, and though it flourished in the age of tragic
dissolution. In the Vatican may be seen two busts, of equal size
and beauty, wrought apparently by the same hand, and finished
to the point of absolute perfection. One of these is Tragedy, the
other Comedy. The two faces differ chiefly in the subtle smile
that plays about the lips of Comedy, and in the slight contraction
of the brows of Tragedy. They are twin sisters, born alike to
royalty, distinguished by such traits of character as tend to disappear
beneath the polish of the world. There is no suggestion
of the Cordax in the one or of the Furies in the other. Both are
self-restrained and dignified in ideality. It was thus that the two
species of the drama appeared to the artists of the later ages of
Hellenic culture.</p>

<p>The student of Greek fragments may not inaptly be compared
to a man who is forming a collection of sea-weeds. Walking
along the border of the unsearchable ocean, he keeps his eyes
fixed upon the pools uncovered at low tide, and with his foot
turns up the heaps of rubbish cast upon the shore. Here and
there a rare specimen of colored coralline or delicately fibred alga
attracts his attention. He stoops, and places the precious fragment
in his wallet, regretting that all his wealth is but the alms
of chance, tossed negligently to him by the fretful waves and wilful
storms. To tread the submarine gardens where these weeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and blossoms flourish is denied him. Even so the scholar can do
no more than skirt the abysses of the past, the unsearchable sea of
oblivion, garnering the waifs and strays offered him by accident.</p>

<p>As Stob&aelig;us provides the most extensive repertory of extracts
from the later Greek tragedians, so it is to Athen&aelig;us we must
turn for comic fragments. This <i>helluo librorum</i> boasted that he
had read eight hundred plays of the middle comedy, and it is obvious
that he was familiar with the whole dramatic literature of
Athens. Yet the use he made of this vast knowledge was comparatively
childish. Interested for the most part in deipnosophy,
or the wisdom of the dinner-table, he displayed his erudition by
accumulating passages about cooks, wines, dishes, and the Attic
market. From an exclusive study, therefore, of the extracts he
transmitted, we might be led to imagine that the Greek comedians
exaggerated the importance of eating and drinking to a
ridiculous extent. This, however, would be a false inference.
The ingenuity of the deipnosophist was shown in bringing his
reading to bear upon a single point, and in adorning the philosophy
of the kitchen with purple patches torn from poetry. We
ought, in truth, rather to conclude that Attic comedy was an almost
inexhaustible mine of information on Attic life in general,
and that illustrations, infinitely various, of the manners, feelings,
prejudices, literature, and ways of thinking of the ancient Greeks
might have been as liberally granted to us as the culinary details
which amused the mind of Athen&aelig;us.</p>

<p>When so much remains intact of Aristophanes, it is not worth
while to do more than mention a few of the fragments preserved
from the other playwrights of the old comedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>. The first
of these in Meineke's collection may be translated, since it stands,
like a motto, on the title-page of all Greek comedy:<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> "Hear, O
ye people! Susarion says this, the son of Philinus, the Megarian,
of Tripodiscus: Women are an evil; and yet, my countrymen,
one cannot set up house without evil; for to be married or not
to be married is alike bad." In turning over the pages of Meineke,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
we feel inclined to call attention to the beauty of some
lines on flowers written by Pherecrates (<i>Metalles</i>, fr. 2, and <i>Persai</i>,
fr. 2), and to a curious passage on the changes wrought by
Melanippides, Kinesias, and Timotheus in Attic music (<i>Cheiron</i>,
fr. 1). The comic description of the Age of Gold by Telecleides
(<i>Amphictyones</i>, fr. 1) might be paralleled by Heine's picture of
heaven, where the geese flew about ready roasted with ladles of
sweet sauce in their bills. What Hermippus says about the Attic
market (<i>Phormophoroi</i>, fr. 1) is interesting for a different reason,
since it throws real light upon the imports into Attica. The second
fragment from the same comedy yields curious information
about Greek wines. After mentioning the peculiar excellences of
several sorts, the poet gives the palm to Saprias, so called because
of its old, mellow, richly scented ripeness. "When the jar is
opened, a perfume goes abroad of violets and roses and hyacinths,
a wonderful scent that fills the house. This nectar is ambrosia
and nectar in one. Keep it for my friends, but to my enemies
give Peparethian." Eupolis supplies a description of parasites
(<i>Kolakes</i>, fr. 1), the first detailed picture of a class that played a
prominent part in Attic social life.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> We may also mention, in
passing, the fragment of a parabasis (<i>Incert. Fab.</i> fr. 1) which
censures the Athenian audience for preferring foreign to native
poets, and contains a reference to Aristophanes. Phrynichus
yields the beautiful epitaph on Sophocles (<i>Mou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>sai</i>, fr. 1) already
quoted;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> nor must his amusing caricature of a bad musician be
passed over (<i>Incert. Fab.</i> fr. 1), for the sake of this line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"Mummy of Muses, ague of nightingales, hymn of Hades."
Those who are curious about Greek games will do well to study
the description of the cottabos in Plato (<i>Zeus Kakoumenos</i>, fr. 1)
and to compare with it a fuller passage from Antiphanes<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> (<i>Aphrodites
Gonai</i>). Plato, again, presents us with a lively picture of
a Greek symposium (<i>Lacones</i>, fr. 1), as well as a very absurd extract
from a cookery-book, whereof the title was &#934;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#958;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8053;
&#964;&#953;&#962; &#8008;&#968;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;, "A new Sauce-science by Philoxenus" (<i>Phaon</i>,
fr. 1). From Ameipsias might be selected for passing notice an
allusion to Socrates (<i>Konnos</i>, fr. 1) and a scolion in two lines upon
life and pleasure, sung to the flute at a drinking-party (<i>Incert.
Fab.</i> fr. 1). Finally, Lysippus has spoken the praises of Athens
in three burlesque iambics<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> (<i>Incert. Fab.</i> fr. 1): "If you have
never seen Athens, you are a stock; if you have seen her, and not
been taken captive, a donkey; if you are charmed and leave her,
a pack-ass."</p>

<p>On quitting the old for the middle comedy we find ourselves
in a different intellectual atmosphere. The wit is more fine-spun,
the humor more allusive; language, metre, and sententious reflections
begin alike to be Euripidean. The fertility of the playwrights
of this period was astounding. Antiphanes, one of the
earliest, produced, according to some authorities, 260, and Alexis,
one of the latest, 245 comedies on a great variety of subjects. It
is doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>, however, whether the authorship of these plays was
accurately known by the Byzantine Greeks, from whom our information
is derived. The fragments show that a strong similarity
of style marked the whole school of poets, and that the
younger did not scruple to pilfer freely from the elder. On the
whole, the question of authorship is of less interest than the matters
brought to light by such extracts as we possess. It has been
remarked above that ridicule of the philosophers and parodies of
the tragic poets were standing dishes in the middle comedy. Antiphanes
has a fling at the elegant attire of the academic sages
(<i>Antaios</i>), while Ephippus describes a philosophical dandy of the
same school (<i>Nauagos</i>, fr. 1, p. 493). Their doctrines are assailed
with mild sarcasm. A man, when asked if he has a soul, replies:
"Plato would tell me I don't know, but I rather think I have"
(Cratinus, <i>Pseudupobolimaios</i>, p. 516). In another play some one
is gently reminded that he is talking of things about which he
knows nothing&mdash;like Plato (Alexis, <i>Ankylion</i>, p. 518). Again,
Plato is informed that his philosophy ends in knowing how to
frown<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> (Amphis, <i>Dexidemides</i>, p. 482). In another place it is
discovered that his <i>summum bonum</i> consists in refraining from
marriage and enjoying life (Philippides, <i>Ananeosis</i>, fr. 2, p. 670).
Other philosophers, the Pythagoreans (Alexis, <i>Tarantini</i>, frs. 1, 2,
3, pp. 565, 566), and Aristippus (<i>Galatea</i>, fr. 1, p. 526), for example,
come in for their share of ridicule. The playwrights not unfrequently
express their own philosophy, sad enough beneath the
mask of mirth. Very gloomy, for example, is the view of immortality
recorded by Antiphanes (<i>Aphrodisios</i>, fr. 2, p. 358);
while the comparison by Alexis of human life to a mad pastime
enjoyed between two darknesses (p. 566) has something in it that
reminds one of a dance of death. Very seldom has the insecurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of all things, leading to devil-may-care self-indulgence, been
more elegantly expressed than by Antiphanes (<i>Stratiotes</i>, fr. 1,
p. 397). Anaxandrides, for his part, formulates theological agnosticism
in words memorable for their pithy brevity (<i>Canephorus</i>,
p. 422):</p>

<p>One thing is clear in all such utterances, that the deeper speculations
of Plato and Aristotle had taken no hold on the minds of
the people at large, and that such philosophy as had penetrated
Athenian society was a kind of hedonistic scepticism. Epicurus,
in the next age, had nothing to do but to give expression to popular
convictions. Take, for one instance more, these lines from
Amphis (<i>Gyn&aelig;cocratia</i>, p. 481):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally, the same keen Attic wit is exercised upon old-fashioned
Greek proverbs. Simonides had said that health,
beauty, and moderate wealth were the three best blessings. Anaxandrides
demurs (<i>Thesaurus</i>, fr. 1, p. 421): the poet was most
certainly mad; for a handsome man, if he be poor, is but an ugly
beast.</p>

<p>A few of the fragments throw some light upon dramatic literature.
Antiphanes (<i>Poesis</i>, fr. 1, p. 392) compares tragedy and
comedy with covert irony: Blest indeed is the lot of a tragic
play, for, to begin with, the spectators know the whole legend by
the name it bears, and then, when the poet gets tired, he has only
to lift the machine like his finger, and, hocus-pocus, all is ended;
but in a comedy everything must be made from the beginning
and explicitly set forth&mdash;persons, previous circumstances, plot,
catastrophe, and episode&mdash;and if a jot or tittle is overlooked, Tom
or Jerry in the pit will hiss us off the stage. The cathartic power
of tragedy is described by Timocles (<i>Dionysiazus&aelig;</i>, p. 614) in
lines that sound like a common-sense version of Aristotle: Man
is born to suffer, and there are many painful things in life; accordingly
he has discovered consolation for his sad thoughts in
tragedies, which lure the mind away to think of greater woes, and
send the hearer soothed, and at the same time lessoned, home&mdash;the
poor man, for example, finds that Telephus was still more
poor, the sick man sees Alcm&aelig;on mad, the lame man pities Philoctetes
and forgets himself; if one has lost a son, Niobe is enough
to teach him resignation; and so on through all the calamitie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>s of
life: gazing at sufferings worse than our own, we are forced to be
contented.</p>

<p>Some of the most charming of the comic fragments are descriptions
of sleep. A comedy variously ascribed to Antiphanes
and Alexis bears the name of Sleep, and contains a dialogue
(p. 570), of which the following is a version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A.</i> Not mortal, nor immortal, but of both<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blent in his being, so that gods nor men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can claim him for their own; but ever fresh<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He grows, and then dies off again to nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unseen by any, but well known to all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>B.</i> Lady, you always charm me thus with riddles.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A.</i> Yet what I say is clear and plain enough.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A.</i> Sleep, O my daughter, he that cures our ills.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Scarcely less delicate are the two following lines (pp. 749, 607):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8005; &#964;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#954;&#945; &#956;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#945;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8055;,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In this connection I may quote a beautiful fragment from
Diphilus (<i>Incert. Fab.</i> fr. 5, p. 647) on Death and Sleep:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no life without its share of evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griefs, persecutions, torments, cares, diseases:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these death comes to cure us, a physician<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gives heart's ease by filling us with slumber.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before engaging in a group of fragments more illustrative of
common Greek life, I will call attention to the examples of Attic
slang furnished by Anaxandrides (<i>Odysseus</i>, fr. 2, p. 424). To
translate them into equivalent English would tax the ingenuity
of Frere; but it is worth noticing that this <i>argot</i>, like that of our
universities or public schools, is made up of the most miscellaneous
material. Religious ritual, the theatre, personal peculiarities,
the dust that is the plague of Athens, articles of dress, and current
fables all supply their quota. It is, in fact, the slang of cultivated
social life.</p>

<p>Next to cooks, parasites, and fishwives, the <i>demi-monde</i> of Athens
plays the most prominent part in comedy of the mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>dle period.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
The following couplet from a play of Philet&aelig;rus (<i>Kunegis</i>,
fr. 3, p. 477) might be chosen as a motto for an essay on this
subject:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#964;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#8166;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#7936;&#955;&#955;' &#959;&#8016;&#967;&#8054; &#947;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7961;&#955;&#955;&#8049;&#948;&#959;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This pithily expresses the pernicious relation in which the mistress,
dignified by the name of companion, stood in Attic Hellas
towards the married wife. The superiority of the former over the
latter in popular appreciation is set forth with cynical directness
by Amphis (<i>Athamas</i>, fr. 1, p. 480).</p>

<p>The Greeks had no sort of shame about intersexual relations;
and of this perfect freedom of speech the comic poets furnish
ample illustration in their dealing with the subject of adultery.
There is not here the faintest trace of French romance. Sentiment
of some kind is required to season the modern breaches of
the seventh commandment. To the Greeks, who felt the minimum
of romance in intersexual love, adultery appeared both dangerous
and silly, when the laws of Solon had so well provided
safety-valves for vice.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> At the same time, the pages of the comic
poets abound in violent invectives against licentious and avaricious
women who were the ruin of young men. Anaxilas (<i>Neottis</i>,
fr. 1, p. 501), in a voluble invective against "companions" of
this sort, can find no language strong enough. They are serpents,
fire-breathing chimeras, Charybdis and Scylla, sea-dogs, sphinxes,
hydras, winged harpies, and so forth. Alexis describes the arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
whereby they make the most of mean attractions, and suit their
style to the current fashion (<i>Isostasion</i>, fr. 1, p. 537). Epicrates
paints the sordid old age of once-worshipped Lais in language
that might serve as a classic pendant to Villon's <i>Regrets de la belle
H&eacute;aulimiere</i> (<i>Antila&iuml;s</i>, fr. 2, p. 510). In no point does the civilized
society of great cities remain so constant as in the characteristics
of Bohemian life. In this respect Athens seems to have
been much the same as Venice in the sixteenth, and Paris in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>What these playwrights say of love in general scarcely differs
from the opinions already quoted from the tragic poets. Amphis
(<i>Dithyrambus</i>, fr. 2, p. 482) and Alexis (<i>Helene</i>, p. 532; <i>Traumatias</i>,
fr. 2, p. 569; <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>, fr. 1, p. 571; <i>Incert. Fab.</i> fr. 38,
p. 582) may be referred to by the curious. It is worth while at
this point to mention that some valuable illustrations of the later
Attic comedy are to be drawn from the collectors of characteristics,
like Theophrastus, and from rhetoricians who condensed the
matter of the comic drama in their prose. The dialogues of Lucian,
the letters of Alciphron, the moral treatises of Plutarch and
Maximus Tyrius, and the dissertations of Athen&aelig;us are especially
valuable in this respect. Much that we have lost in its integrity
is filtered for us through the medium of scholastic literature, performing
for the middle comedy imperfectly that which Latin literature
has done more completely for the new.</p>

<p>In dealing with the old comedy, one reference has been already
made to cooks and cookery-books. In the middle comedy they
assume still more importance, and in the secondary authors of the
new comedy they occupy the foreground of the picture, thanks to
Athen&aelig;us. Cooks at Athens formed a class apart. They had
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> stations in the market, their schools, their libraries of culinary
lore, their pedantries and pride and special forms of knavery.
The Roman custom of keeping slaves to cook at home had not
yet penetrated into Greece. If a man wanted to entertain his
guests at a dinner-party, or to prepare a wedding-feast, he had to
seek the assistance of a professional <i>cordon bleu</i>, and the great
<i>chef</i> ensconced himself for the day, with his subordinates, in the
house of his employer. It is clear that these customs offered situations
of rare comic humor to the playwright. Everybody had
at some time felt the need of the professional cook, and everybody
had suffered under him. In an age, moreover, which was
nothing if it was not literary, the cooks caught the prevailing

<p>exclaims one of the characters of Alexis (<i>Milesia</i>, fr. 1, p. 551),
after a scientific demonstration of the sin of letting sauces cool.
A paterfamilias in a play of Strato (<i>Ph&#339;nikides</i>, p. 703) complains
that he has brought a "male sphinx" in the shape of a cook
into his house. The fellow will not condescend to use any but
Homeric language, and the master is quite puzzled. It is in vain
that he takes down the Homeric glossary of Philetas. Even this
does not mend matters. The cook is a more recondite scholar
than the grammarian. A professor of the culinary art in a play
of Nicomachus (<i>Eileithuia</i>, p. 717) explains to his employer the
broad scientific basis upon which the art of cooking rests. Astrology,
geometry, medicine, and natural history are all necessary.
Another, in Damoxenus <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>(<i>Syntrophi</i>, p. 697), discusses various
schools of philosophy from the culinary point of view. He begins
by saying that he has spent four talents and nearly three
years in the school of Epicurus, and has learned that a cook who
has not mastered metaphysics is worthless. He must have Democritus
and Epicurus at his fingers' ends, understand the elements
of fire and water, comprehend the laws of harmony, and
arrive at a profound contempt for Stoical self-discipline.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The
study of cookery-books employs as much time and demands as
much enthusiasm as the study of the sages. A cook in Baton
(<i>Euerget&aelig;</i>, p. 685) shakes off sleep and trims the midnight oil
that he may meditate the weighty precepts of his masters in the
art.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Another, in Euphron (<i>Adelphi</i>, p. 679), expounds the various
virtues of his predecessors, and remarks that his own peculiar
merit consists in clever larceny. The same author makes a cook
explain to his pupil the distinctions he ought to observe in catering
for a club and for a wedding-party (<i>Synephebi</i>, p. 682). One
of the fragments of Menander turns, finally, upon the art of treating
guests of different nationalities to different dishes (<i>Trophonius</i>,
p. 46). In this passage Menander seems to have had in
mind some lines of Diphilus (<i>Apolipousa</i>, fr. 1, p. 633). Another
curious extract from the latter poet (<i>Zographus</i>, fr. 2, p. 638)
consists of a long harangue delivered by a master-cook to his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>,
a waiter, concerning the advantages and disadvantages of various
houses into which he gains admittance by his art. A merchant
just returned from sea, a spendthrift heir, and a leader of
the <i>demi-monde</i> are good customers because of their prodigality.
On the whole, the impression left upon our minds is that, what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>with democracy, all-pervading pedantry, and professional pride,
high life below stairs in Athens was even more difficult to tolerate
than it is in England.</p>

<p>To draw a firm line of demarcation between the middle and the
new comedy would be impossible. I have already expressed my
opinion that the comic drama culminated, within the limits determined
for it by antique society, in the art of Menander. The
modulations through which it passed before attaining to this final
stage were numerous, and there are indications that the types invented
for the middle comedy persisted in the new. What really
created the third manner, and carried the comic art to its perfection,
was the appearance of a truly original genius in the person
of Menander. The playwrights who succeeded could not fail to
feel his influence, and plied their craft within the sphere he had
traced.</p>

<p>Menander was the nephew of Alexis, the pupil of Theophrastus,
the exact contemporary and intimate friend of Epicurus. From
his uncle he received the traditions of dramatic art; from his master
he learned the peripatetic method of analysis; together with
his friend he put in practice the philosophy of &#7936;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945; which
passes by the name of Epicureanism. His adequacy to the spirit
of his own age can only be paralleled by that which we observe in
Sophocles. As Sophocles exactly represents the period of Attic
perfection, so the sadder and more sober years of disillusionment
and premature decay find full expression in Menander. His personal
beauty, the love of refined pleasure that distinguished him
in life, the serene and genial temper of his wisdom, the polish of
his verse, and the harmony of parts he observed in composit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ion,
justify us in calling Menander the Sophocles of comedy. Like
Sophocles, he showed the originality of his genius by defining the
limits of his art. He perfected the comic drama by restricting it
more closely to real life. The love-tales&mdash;&#7956;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#966;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#8055;&mdash;which
Anaxandrides is said to have introduced, became the
fixed material of the new comedy. Menander, however, used this
subject-matter less for sensational effect or sentimental pathos
than for the expression of a deep and tranquil wisdom. If we
were to judge by the fragments transmitted to us, we should have
to say that Menander's comedy was ethical philosophy in verse;
so mature is their wisdom, so weighty their language, and so grave
their tone. The brightness of the beautiful Greek spirit is sobered
down in him almost to sadness. Middle age, with its maturity,
has been substituted for youth with its passionate intensity.
Taking Menander for our guide, we cannot cry: "You Greeks are
always children." Yet the fact that Stob&aelig;us found him a fruitful
source of sententious quotations, and that alphabetical anthologies
were made of his proverbial sayings, ought not to obscure
his fame for drollery and humor. The highest praise awarded by
the Romans to Terence is contained in the apostrophe <i>dimidiate
Menander</i>; and it appears that what the Latin critics thought their
poet wanted was the salt of Attic wit, the playful ease and lively
sparkle of his master. It is certain that well-constructed plots,
profound analysis of character, refined humor, and ripe philosophy
were blent and subordinated to the harmony of beauty by
Menander. If old men appreciated his genial or pungent worldly
wisdom, boys and girls read him, we are told, for his love-stories.
One thing at least he never could have been&mdash;loud or vulgar. And
for this reason, perhaps, we learn less from Menander about parasites
and cooks than from his fellow dramatists.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>Speaking broadly, the philosophy in vogue at Athens during
the period of the new comedy was what in modern days is known
as Epicureanism. This is proved by the frequent references made
by playwrights to pleasure as the <i>sumum bonum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> as well as by
their view of life in general. Yet it would be unjust to confound
the grave and genial wisdom of Menander with so trivial a philosophy
as that which may be summed up in the sentence "Eat
and drink, for to-morrow we die."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> A fragment from an unknown
play of his expresses the pathos of human existence with
a depth of feeling that is inconsistent with mere pleasure-seeking
(p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When thou wouldst know thyself, what man thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at the tombstones as thou passest by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within those monuments lie bones and dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of monarchs, tyrants, sages, men whose pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose high because of wealth, or noble blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haughty soul, or loveliness of limb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet none of these things strove for them 'gainst time:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One common death hath ta'en all mortal men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See thou to this, and know thee who thou art.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such moralizing sounds commonplace to us who have been lessoned
by the <i>memento mori</i> of the Middle Ages. Yet it should
be remembered that, coming <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>from a Greek of Menander's age, it
claims originality of insight, and even now a ring of freshness as
well as of truth marks its absolute sincerity. The following fragment
(p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>) again expresses Stoical, rather than Epicurean, philosophy
of life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Being a man, ask not release from pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strength to bear pain, from the gods above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wouldst fain escape all woe for aye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must become god, or, if not, a corpse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The exquisite lines in which the life of man is compared to a
fair, wherefrom, when he has once seen the shows, he should be
glad to pass away again in quiet, might be adduced to prove, if it
were necessary, that Menander was no mere hedonist. To the
same end might be quoted the passage upon destiny, which explains
that chance and providence are only two names for one
controlling power, face to face with which human forethought is
but smoke and nonsense.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> There is something even almost awful
in the placid acquiescence of Menander. He has come to the
end of passions and pleasures; he expects pain and is prepared to
endure it; his happiness consists in tranquil contemplation of
life, from which he no longer hopes for more than what Balzac
calls the <i>&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s</i> of felicity.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This tranquillity does not diminish,
but rather increases, his power of enjoyment and the clearness
of his vision. He combines the exact knowledge of the scientific
analyst with judicial impartiality; and yet his worldly wisdom
is not cold or dry. To make selections from fragments, every
word whereof is golden, would be weary work; nor is it possible
to preserve i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>n translation the peculiar savor of this Attic salt.
Menander should be spared this profanation. Before we leave
him, let us remember what Goethe, a man as like Menander as a
modern man can be, has said of him: "He is thoroughly pure,
noble, great, and cheerful, and his grace is unattainable. It is to
be lamented that we possess so little of him, but that little is invaluable."</p>

<p>The name of Philemon will always be coupled with that of
Menander. In their lifetime they were competitors, and the
Athenian audience preferred Philemon to his rival. Posterity in
ancient days reversed this judgment&mdash;with justice, if our scanty
fragments may be taken as sufficient basis for comparison. The
lines in which Philemon praises peace as the good vainly sought
by sages, and declares that no painter or statuary can compete
with truth, are fair examples of his fluent and at the same time
polished style.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> So are the comparison of men with animals to
the disadvantage of the former, and the invective against Prometheus
for dividing human nature into complex varieties of character.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Yet there is an element of sophistry in these examples,
placing them below the pithy sayings of Menander. If I were to
choose one fragment as illustrative of Philemon, and at the same
time favorable to his reputation, it should be the following:<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have faith in God and fear; seek not to know him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou wilt gain naught else beyond thy search:<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>The comedy of Menander determined the form of the drama in
Rome, and, through the influence of Plautus and Terence upon
the renascent culture of the sixteenth century, fixed the type of
comedy in modern Europe. We are often struck, in reading his
fragments, with their modern tone of thought and feeling. We
recognize that here, as in the case of Moli&egrave;re, is a man who "chastised
men by drawing them as they are," and that the men whom
he chastised, the social follies he ridiculed, are among us at the
present day. This observation leads us to consider what we mean
by modernism, when we say we find it in ancient literature.
Sometimes the phrase is loosely used to indicate the permanent
and invariable qualities of human nature emergent from local and
temporary conditions. The chorus in the <i>Agamemnon</i> upon the
beautiful dead warriors in the Trojan war is called modern because
it comes home directly to our own experience. Not their
special mode of sepulture, or the lamentation of captive women
over their heaped-up mounds, or the slaughter of human victims,
or the trophies raised upon their graves, are touched upon. Such
circumstances would dissociate them, if only accidentally, from
our sympathies. It is the grief of those who stay at home and
mourn, the pathos of youth and beauty wasted, that &AElig;schylus has
chosen for his threnos. This grief and this pathos are imperishable,
and are therefore modern, inasmuch as they are not specifically
ancient. Yet such use of the phrase is inaccurate. We
come closer to the true meaning through the etymology of the
word modern, derived perhaps from <i>modo</i>, or <i>just now</i>; so that
what is modern is, strictly speaking, that which belongs to the
present moment. From this point of view modernism must continually
be changing, for the moment now is in perpetual flux.
Still, there is one characteristic of the now which comprehends
the modern world, that does not and cannot alter: we are never
free from the conscio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>usness of a long past. <i>Nous vieillards n&eacute;s
d'hier</i> is essentially true of us; and to this characteristic may be
referred what we mean to express by modernism. When nations
have reached a certain growth and pitch of culture, certain sentiments,
affectations, ways of thinking, modes of self-expression,
habits of life, fashions, and the like, appear as the outcome of
complex and long-established social conditions. Whatever may be
the political groundwork of the national existence, the phase in
question is sure to manifest itself, if only the nation lasts for a
sufficient length of time. We, who have assuredly arrived at the
climacteric in question, when we recognize the signs of it elsewhere,
call them modern; and nowhere can we find them more
emphatically marked than in the age of Attic ripeness that produced
Menander. "O Menander and life," said the grammarian
of Alexandria, "which of you is the imitator of the other?" This
apostrophe might also have been addressed to Homer; but what
made it more specially applicable to Menander was that, while
Homer invested the profound truths of passion and action with
heroic dignity, Menander drew a no less faithful picture of human
life together with the accidents of civilized and social circumstance.
His delicate delineation of Attic society seemed nearer
to the Alexandrian scholar, because it reproduced, not the remote
conditions of the prehistoric age, but those which are common to
periods of advanced culture. For a like reason he seems to us
more obviously modern than Homer. He contemplates the drama
of human life with eyes and mind not very differently trained
from ours, and from a point of view close to ours. As a single
instance, take this fragment. He is quietly laughing at the pompous
and pretentious sages who said in Athens, as they say now,
that a man must go into the wilderness to discover truth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#8055; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#8055;&#945;&#957;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We must not, however, be blinded by the modernism of Menander
to the fact that ancient comedy differed in many most important
respects from the comedy of modern Europe. If we only
regard dramas of intrigue and manners, such as the <i>Mandragola</i>
of Machiavelli, the <i>Volpone</i> of Ben Jonson, or the <i>Fourberies de
Scapin</i> of Moli&egrave;re, we are indeed dealing with a type of comedy
derived directly through the Latin from the Greek. But modern
comedy does not remain within these narrow limits. Its highest
products are either works of pure creative fancy, like Shakespeare's
<i>Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> and Fletcher's <i>Pilgrim</i>, or are
so closely allied to tragedy, as in the case of Massinger's <i>A New
Way to Pay Old Debts</i> and Moli&egrave;re's <i>Avare</i>, that only a nominal
difference divides the two species. Nothing remains, either in
fragments or in critical notices, to justify us in believing that the
ancients developed either the serious comedy, essentially tragic in
its ruthless revelation of a hell of evil passion, or the comedy of
pure imagination. Their strict sense of the requirements of external
form excluded the former kind of drama, while for the creation
of the latter the free play of the romantic fancy was absolutely
necessary. The total loss of Agathon, Ch&aelig;remon, and other
tragic poets of the post-Euripidean period, forces us to speak with
reservation on this topic. There are many indications of a confusion
of types at Athens during the fourth century B.C. analogous
to that which characterizes modern dramatic poetry. Yet it
may be asserted wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>h tolerable confidence that, while the Greeks
understood by comedy a form of art that aimed at exciting mirth
and was confined within the limits of domestic life, modern comedy
has not unfrequently in her higher flights excited the passions
of terror and pity, and has quitted the region of diurnal prose for
the dream-world of fairyland. An ancient critic would have probably
observed that Moli&egrave;re's <i>Avare</i> was too seriously sinister to be
rightly called comic, and that the absence of parody or burlesque in
Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i> excluded that play from comparison with
the <i>Birds</i> of Aristophanes. Here, then, as elsewhere, we have to
notice the greater freedom demanded by the modern fancy in
dealing with the forms of art, together with the absence of those
firmly traced critical canons to which the antique genius willingly
submitted. Modern art in general, when it is not directly and
consciously imitative of antique models, demands a more complete
liberation of the spiritual element. We cannot avoid <i>les d&eacute;fauts
de nos qualit&eacute;s</i>. This superior freedom involves a bewildering
complexity and intermixture of the serious and the ludicrous, the
lyrical and the dramatic, the positive and the fanciful, defying
classification, and in its very caprice approximating to the realities
of existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>


<p>Of the lives of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus there is very little
known, and that little has been often repeated. Theocritus
was a Syracusan, the son of Praxagoras and Philinna. Some confusion
as to his parentage arose from the fact that in the seventh
idyl Theocritus introduced himself under the artificial name of
Simichidas, which led early critics to suppose he had a father
called Simichus. It is, however, quite clear that the concurrent
testimony of Suidas and of an epigram in the anthology, which
distinctly asserts his descent from Praxagoras and Philinna, is to
be accepted in preference to all conjectures founded on a <i>nom de
plume</i>. Theocritus flourished between 283 and 263 B.C., but the
dates and circumstances of his birth and death are alike unknown.
We may gather, inferentially or directly from his poems, that he
sought the patronage of Ptolemy Philadelphus at Alexandria, and
lived for some time among the men of letters at his court. Indeed,
Theocritus was the most brilliant ornament of that somewhat
artificial period of literature; he above all the Alexandrian
poets carried the old genius of Greece into new channels instead
of imitating, annotating, and rehandling ancient masterpieces.
The sixth and seventh idyls prove that Aratus, the astronomer,
was a familiar friend of the Syracusan bard; probably the frequent
allusions to meteorology and the science of the stars which
we trace in the poems of Theocritus may be referred to this intimacy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>From the idyls, again, we learn that the poet left Alexandria
wearied with court life, and, like Spenser, unwilling</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To lose good nights that might be better spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To waste long days in pensive discontent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed on hope, and pine with fear and sorrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He seems, however, to have once more made trial of princely favor
at the Syracusan court of Hiero, and to have been as much
offended with the want of appreciation and good taste as with the
illiberality that he found there. Among his friends were numbered
Nicias, the physician of Miletus, and his wife Theugenis, to
whom he addressed the beautiful little poem called &#7968;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8053;, or
<i>The Distaff</i>&mdash;a charming specimen of what the Greek muse could
produce by way of <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>. The end of his life is buried
in obscurity. We can easily believe that he spent it quietly among
the hills and fields of Sicily, in close communion with the nature
that he loved so well. His ill success as a court poet does not astonish
us; the panegyrics of Hiero and Ptolemy are among his
worst poems&mdash;mere pinchbeck when compared with the pure gold
of the idyls proper. It was in scenes of natural beauty that he
felt at home, and when he died he left a volume of immortal verse,
each line of which proclaims of him&mdash;"Et ego in Arcadia." We
cannot give him a more fitting epitaph than that of his own
Daphnis:</p>

</div></div>

<p>If we know little of Theocritus, less is known of Bion. Suidas
says that he was born at Smyrna, and the elegy written on his
death leads us to suppose that he lived in Sicily, and died of poison
wilfully administered by enemies. Theocritus, though his
senior in age and his predecessor in bucolic poetry, seems to have
survived him. Bion's elegist, from which the few facts which we
have related with regard to the poet of Smyrna's life and untimely
death are gathered, has generally been identified with Moschus.
Ahrens, however, with characteristic German scepticism, places the
&#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#8049;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#914;&#8055;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; upon a list of <i>Incertorum Idyllia</i>. Nor can it
be denied that the author of this poem leads us to believe that he
was a native of Magna Gr&aelig;cia, whereas Moschus is known to have
been a Syracusan. The third and last of the Sicilian idyllists, he
stands at a great distance from Theocritus in all essential qualities
of pastoral composition. He has more of the grammarian or man
of erudition about him; and we can readily conceive him to have
been, according to the account of Suidas, a friend of Aristarchus.
Of the dates of his life nothing can be recorded with any certainty.
He seems to have lived about the end of the third century
B.C.</p>

<p>During the short period in which bucolic poetry flourished under
Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, Syracuse remained beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
sceptre of Hiero. While the bloody strife was being waged between
Rome and Carthage for the empire of the Mediterranean,
Syracuse, intermediate between the two great combatants, was
able not only to maintain a splendid independence under the sway
of her powerful tyrant, but also to afford the Romans signal aid
upon the battle-fields of Sicily. In Sicily the sun of Greece still
shone with some of its old radiance on the spots where, before
Athens had assumed the intellectual supremacy of Hellas, poetry,
philosophy, and all the arts of life had first displayed their splendid
spring-time. The island in which the April of the Greek
spirit had disclosed its earliest flowers now bore the last but not
least lovely wreath of autumn. The winter was soon coming.
Rome and her Verres were already looking upon Trinacria as
their prey; and the idyllic garland was destined to crown with
exotic blossoms the brows of Virgil.</p>

<p>About the authenticity of many of the idyls grave questions
have been raised. It is hard to believe that all the thirty which
bear the name of Theocritus were really written by him. The
twenty-third and twenty-fifth, for instance, are not in his style;
while the nineteenth reminds us more of the Anacreontic elegance
of Bion or Moschus than of his peculiarly vigorous workmanship.
The twenty-ninth, again, though admitted as genuine by Ahrens,
might well pass for the work of an earlier &AElig;olic writer. But, without
some shock to my feelings, I cannot entertain the spuriousness
of the twenty-first idyl, which Ahrens places among the productions
of some doubtful author. The whole series after the eighteenth
have been questioned. These, however, include the epical
compositions of Theocritus, who might well have assumed a different
manner when treating of Hercules or the Dioscuri from
that in which he sang the loves of Lycidas and Da<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>phnis. That
they are inferior to his pastorals is not to be wondered at; for he
who blows his own flute with skill may not be, therefore, strong
enough to sound the trumpet of Homer. Ahrens, as observed
above, extends his criticism to the lament for Bion, which, I confess,
appears to me more full of fire and inventive genius than
any other of the poems attributed to Moschus.</p>

<p>Yet in these matters of minute evidence too much depends
upon mere conjecture and comparison of styles for us to remove
old landmarks with certainty. Suppose all records of Raphael's
works had been lost, and a few fragments of the Cartoons, together
with the Transfiguration and the little picture of the Sleeping
Knight alone remained of all his paintings, would not some
Ahrens be inclined to attribute the Sleeping Knight to a weaker
if not less graceful artist of the Umbrian school? The <i>Allegro</i>
and <i>Penseroso</i> might, by a similar process of disjunctive criticism,
be severed from the <i>Paradise Lost</i>. On the other hand, nothing
can be more doubtful than assertions in favor of authenticity. It
is almost impossible for a foreigner to perceive minute differences
of style in the works of two contemporary poets, and infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
more difficult for a modern to exercise the same exact discrimination
in deciding on the monuments of classic art. Schlegel, in
his <i>History of Dramatic Literature</i>, asserts that he discovers no
internal difference between Massinger and Fletcher. Yet an English
student is struck by the most marked divergences of feeling,
language, natural gifts, and acquired habits of thought in these
two dramatists. Thus the difficulty of such criticism is twofold.
If a Syracusan of 200 B.C. could discuss our lucubrations on the
text of the bucolic poets, he would probably in one case express
astonishment at our having ascribed two dissimilar idyls to Theocritus,
and in another case explain away our scepticism by enumerating
the three or four successive manners of the poet. Theocritus,
Bion, and Moschus are the eponyms of idyllic poetry.
To each belongs a peculiar style. It is quite possible that some
idyls of successful imitators whose names have been lost may
have been fathered upon the three most eminent founders of the
school.</p>

<p>The name of the idyl sufficiently explains its nature. It is a
little picture. Rustic or town life, legends of the gods, and passages
of personal experience supply the idyllist with subjects. He
does not treat them lyrically, following rather the rules of epic
and dramatic composition. Generally there is a narrator, and in
so far the idyl is epic; its verse, too, is the hexameter. But occasionally
the form of dramatic monologue, as in the <i>Pharmaceutria</i>,
or that of dramatic dialogue, as in the <i>Adoniazus&aelig;</i>, takes the
place of narrative. Bion's lament for Adonis, again, is a kind of
sacred hymn; while the dirge on Bion's death is elegiac. Two
idyls of Theocritus are encomiastic; several celebrate the deeds
of ancestral Doric heroes&mdash;Herakles and the Dioscuri. One is an
epistle. Many of Bion's so-called idyls differ little, except in
metre, from the Anacreontics, while one at least of the most highly
finished pieces of Theocritus must be ranked with erotic poetry
of the purely lyrical order. It will be seen from these instances
that the idyllic genus admitted many species, and that the idyllists
were far from being simply pastoral poets. This form of
composition was, in fact, the growth of a late age of Greek art,
when the great provinces had been explored and occupied, and
when the inventor of a new style could legitimately adopt the
tone and manner of his various predecessors. Perhaps the plastic
arts determined the direction of idyllic poetry, suggesting the
name and supplying the poet with models of compact and picturesque
treatment. In reading the idyls it should never be forgotten
that they are pictures, so studied and designed by their authors.
They ought to affect us in the same way as the bass-reliefs
and vases of Greek art, in which dramatic action is presented at
one moment of its evolution, and beautiful forms are grouped together
with such simplicity as to need but little story to enhance
their value. If we approach the idyls from this point of view,
and regard them as very highly finished works of decorative art,
we shall probably be able to enjoy their loveliness without complaining
that the shepherds and shepherdesses are too refined, or
that the landscapes have not been drawn from nature.</p>

<p>Without discussing the whole hackneyed question of bucolic
poetry, a word must be said about its origin, and about the essential
difference between Theocritus and modern pastorals. It is
natural to suppose that country folk, from the remotest period of
Greek history, refreshed themselves with dance and song, and that
music formed a part of their religious ceremonials. The trials of
strength which supply the <i>motive</i> of so many Theocritean idyls
were quite consistent with the manners of the Greeks, who brought
all rival claims of superiority to the touchstone of such contests.
Their antiquity in the matter of music may be gathered from the
legends of Pan and Apollo, and of Apollo and Marsyas. Ph&#339;bus,
in the character of shepherd to Admetus, gave divine sanction to
bucolic minstrelsy. In respect of bodily strength, the gymnastic
rivalry of Olympia and other great Hellenic centres was so important
as to determine the chronology of Greece, while even
claims to personal beauty were decided by the same trial: the
three goddesses submitted to the arbitration of Paris; and there
were in many states &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#945; of physical charms, not to mention
the boys' prize for kisses at Nis&aelig;an Megara. Bucolic poetry may
therefore be referred to the pastoral custom of shepherds singing
together and against each other at festivals or on the green.</p>

<p>It was the genius of Theocritus in all probability which determined
the Doric and Sicilian character of the idyls we possess.
He, a Syracusan and a Dorian, perfected the <i>genre</i>, and was followed
by his imitators. Nothing can be more simple and lifelike
than the conversations of his rustics, or more nicely discriminated
than the pedestrian style of their dialogue and the more polished
manner of their studied songs. The poet has, no doubt, invested
these rural encounters with the imaginative beauty which belongs
to art. He has attributed to Corydon and Thyrsis much of his
own imagination and delicate taste and exquisite sense of natural
loveliness. Had he refrained from doing so, his idyls would not
have challenged the attention and won the admiration of posterity.
As it is, we find enough of rustic grossness on his pages, and
even complain that his cowherds and goatherds savor too
strongly of their stables. Of his appreciation of scenery it is difficult
to speak in terms of exaggerated praise. As I purpose to
discuss this subject more minutely further on, it may here be
enough to remark that he alone of pastoral poets drew straight
from nature, and fully felt the charm which underlies the facts of
rustic life.</p>

<p>In comparison with Theocritus, Bion and Moschus are affected
and insipid. Their pastorals smack of the study more than of
the fields. Virgil not only lacks his vigor and enthusiasm for
the open-air life of the country, but, with Roman bad taste, he
commits the capital crime of allegorizing. Virgil's pernicious example
infected Spenser, Milton, and a host of inferior imitators,
flooding literature with dreary pastorals in which shepherds discussed
politics, religion, and court-gossip, so that at last bucolic
poetry became a synonym for everything affected and insipid.
Poetry flourishes in cities, where rustic song must always be an
exotic plant. To analyze Poliziano, Sanazaro, Guarini, Tasso,
Spenser, Fletcher, Jonson, Barnfield, Browne, Pope, etc., and to
show what strains of natural elegance adorn their imitations of
the ancients, would be a very interesting but lengthy task. As
society became more artificial, especially at Florence, Paris, and
Versailles, the taste for pseudo-pastorals increased. Court-ladies
tucked up their petticoats and carried crooks with ribbons at
their tops, while court-poets furnished aristocratic Corydons with
smooth verses about pipes and pine-trees, and lambs and wattled
cotes. The whole was a dream and a delusion; but this mirage
of rusticity appropriated the <i>name</i> of pastoral, and reflected discredit
even on the great and natural Theocritus. At length this
<i>genre</i> of composition, in which neither invention nor observation
nor truth nor excellence of any kind except inglorious modulation
of old themes was needed, died a natural death; and the true
bucolic genius found fresh channels. Crabbe revived an interest
in village life; Burns sang immortal lyrics at the plough; Goethe
achieved a masterpiece of idyllic delineation; Wordsworth reasserted
the claims of natural simplicity; Keats expressed the sensuous
charms of rustic loveliness; Tennyson and Barnes have
written rural idyls in the dialects of Lincolnshire and Dorsetshire;
while other writers are pursuing similar lines of composition.
Theocritus, it is true, differs widely from these poets both
in his style and matter. But he deserves to rank among the
most realistic artists of the nineteenth century on account of his
simplicity and perfect truth to nature. In reading him we must
divest ourselves of any prejudices which we have acquired from
the perusal of his tasteless imitators. We must take his volume
with us to the scenes in which he lived, and give him a fair trial
on his own merits.</p>

<p>It is on the shores of the Mediterranean&mdash;at Sorrento, at
Amalfi, or near Palermo, or among the valleys of Mentone&mdash;that
we ought to study Theocritus, and learn the secret of his
charm.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Few of us pass middle life without visiting one or other
of these sacred spots, which seem to be the garden of perpetual
spring. Like the lines of the Sicilian idyllist, they inspire an
inevitable and indescribable &#960;&#8057;&#952;&#959;&#962;, touching our sense of beauty
with a subtle power, and soothing our spirits with the majesty of
classical repose. Straight from the sea-beach rise mountains of
distinguished form, not capped with snow or clothed with pines,
but carved of naked rock. We must accept their beauty as it is,
nude, well defined, and unadorned, nor look in vain for the mystery
or sublimity or picturesqueness of the Alps. Light and color
are the glory of these mountains. Valleys divide their flanks,
seaming with shadow-belts and bands of green the broad hillside,
while lower down the olives spread a hoary grayness and soft
robe of silver mist, the skirts of which are kissed by tideless
waves. The harmony between the beauty of the olive-boughs
and the blue sea can be better felt than described. Guido, whose
subtlety of sentiment was very rare, has expressed it in one or
two of his earliest and best pictures by graduated tones of silver,
azure and cool gray. The definite form and sunny brightness of
the olive-tree suits our conception of the Greek character. It
may well have been the favorite plant of the wise and calm Athene.
Oaks with their umbrageous foliage, pine-trees dark and
mournful upon Alpine slopes, branching limes, and elms in which
the wind sways shadowy masses of thick leaves, belong, with their
huge girth and gnarled boles and sombre roof-age, to the forests
of the North, where nature is rather an awful mother than a kind
foster-nurse and friend of man. In northern landscapes the eye
travels through vistas of leafy boughs to still, secluded crofts and
pastures, where slow-moving oxen graze. The mystery of dreams
and the repose of meditation haunt our massive bowers. But in
the South, the lattice-work of olive boughs and foliage scarcely
veils the laughing sea and bright blue sky, while the hues of the
landscape find their climax in the dazzling radiance of the sun
upon the waves, and the pure light of the horizon. There is no
concealment and no melancholy here. Nature seems to hold a
never-ending festival and dance, in which the waves and sunbeams
and shadows join. Again, in Northern scenery, the rounded forms
of full-foliaged trees suit the undulating country, with its gentle
hills and brooding clouds; but in the South the spiky leaves and
sharp branches of the olive carry out the defined outlines which
are everywhere observable through the broader beauties of mountain
and valley and sea-shore. Serenity and intelligence characterize
this Southern landscape, in which a race of splendid men
and women lived beneath the pure light of Ph&#339;bus, their an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>cestral
god. Pallas protected them, and golden Aphrodite favored
them with beauty. Nations as great and noble have arisen among
the oak and beech woods of the North; strong-sinewed warriors,
heroic women, counsellors with mighty brains, and poets on whose
tongue the melody of music lingers like a charm. But the Greeks
alone owned the gift of innate beauty and unerring taste. The
human form, upon those bare and sunny hills, beneath those
twinkling olive-boughs, beside that sea of everlasting laughter,
reached its freedom; and the spirit of human loveliness was there
breathed fully into all the forms of art. Poetry, sculpture, architecture,
music, dancing, all became the language of that moderate
and lucid harmony which we discover in the landscape of the
Greeks.</p>

<p>Olives are not, however, by any means the only trees which play
a part in idyllic scenery. The tall stone-pine is even more important;
for, underneath its shade the shepherds loved to sing,
hearing the murmur in its spreading roof, and waiting for the
cones with their sweet fruit to fall. Near Massa, by Sorrento,
there are two gigantic pines so placed that, lying on the grass
beneath them, one looks on Capri rising from the sea, Bai&aelig;,
and all the bay of Naples sweeping round to the base of Vesuvius.
Tangled growths of olives, oranges, and rose-trees fill the
garden-ground along the shore, while far away in the distance
pale Inarime sleeps, with her exquisite Greek name, a virgin island
on the deep. In such a place we realize Theocritean melodies,
and find a new and indestructible loveliness in the opening
line of his first idyl:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#7937;&#948;&#8059; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#968;&#953;&#952;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7937; &#960;&#8055;&#964;&#965;&#962;, &#945;&#7984;&#960;&#8057;&#955;&#949;, &#964;&#8053;&#957;&#945;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These pines are few and far between. Growing alone or in
pairs, they stand like monuments upon the hills, their black forms
sculptured on the cloudlike olive-groves, from which at intervals
spring spires and columns of slender cypress-trees.</p>

<p>Here and there in this bright garden of the age of gold white
villages are seen, and solitary cottage roofs high up among the
hills&mdash;dwellings, perhaps, of Amaryllis, whom the shepherds used
to serenade. Huge fig-trees lean their weight of leaves and purple
fruit upon the cottage walls, while cherry-trees and apricots
snow the grass in spring with a white wealth of April blossoms.
The stone walls and little wells in the cottage gardens are green
with immemorial moss and ferns, and fragrant with gadding violets
that ripple down their sides and checker them with blue. On
the wilder hills you find patches of ilex and arbutus glowing with
crimson berries and white waxen bells, sweet myrtle rods and
shafts of bay, frail tamarisk and tall tree-heaths that wave their
frosted boughs above your head. Nearer the shore the lentisk
grows, a savory shrub, with cytisus and aromatic rosemary. Clematis
and polished garlands of tough sarsaparilla wed the shrubs
with clinging, climbing arms; and here and there in sheltered
nooks the vine shoots forth luxuriant tendrils bowed with grapes
stretching from branch to branch of mulberry or elm, flinging
festoons on which young loves might sit and swing, or weaving a
lattice-work of leaves across the open shed. Nor must the sounds
of this landscape be forgotten&mdash;sounds of bleating flocks, and
murmuring bees, and nightingales, and doves that moan, and running
streams, and shrill cicadas, and hoa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>rse frogs, and whispering
pines. There is not a single detail which a patient student may
not verify from Theocritus.</p>

<p>Then, too, it is a landscape in which sea and country are never
sundered. This must not be forgotten of idyllic scenery; for it
was the warm seaboard of Sicily, beneath protecting heights of
&AElig;tna, that gave birth to the bucolic muse. The intermingling
of pastoral and sea life is exquisitely allegorized in the legend of
Galatea; and on the cup which Theocritus describes in his first
idyl the fisherman plays an equal part with the shepherd youths
and the boy who watches by the vineyard wall. The higher we
climb upon the mountain-side the more marvellous is the beauty
of the sea, which seems to rise as we ascend and stretch into the
sky. Sometimes a little flake of blue is framed by olive-boughs,
sometimes a turning in the road reveals the whole broad azure
calm below. Or after toiling up a steep ascent we fall upon the
undergrowth of juniper, and lo! a double sea, this way and that,
divided by the sharp spine of the jutting hill, jewelled with villages
along its shore, and smiling with fair islands and silver sails.
Upon the beach the waves come tumbling in, swaying the corallines
and green and purple sea-weeds in the pools. Ceaseless
beating of the spray has worn the rocks into jagged honeycombs,
on which lazy fishermen sit perched, dangling their rods like figures
in Pompeian frescos.</p>

<p>In landscapes such as these we are readily able to understand
the legends of rustic gods; the metamorphoses o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>f Syrinx, Narcissus,
Echo, Hyacinthus, and Adonis; the tales of slumbering
Pan and horned satyrs and peeping fauns with which the idyllists
have adorned their simple shepherd songs. Here, too, the
Oread dwellers of the hills and dryads and sylvans and water-nymphs
seem possible. They lose their unreality and mythic
haziness; for men themselves are more a part of Nature here than
in the North, more fit for companionship with deities of stream
and hill. Their labors are lighter and their food more plentiful.
Summer leaves them not, and the soil yields fair and graceful
crops. There is surely some difference between hoeing turnips
and trimming olive-boughs, between tending turkeys on a Norfolk
common and leading goats to browse on cytisus beside the shore
between the fat pasturage and bleak winters of our midland counties
and the spare herbage of the South dried by perpetual sunlight.
It cannot be denied that men assimilate something from
their daily labor, and that the poetry of rustic life is more evident
upon Mediterranean shores than in England.</p>

<p>Nor must the men and women of classical landscape be forgotten.
When we read the idyls of Theocritus, and wish to see before
us Thestylis and Daphnis and Lycidas, we have but to recall
the perfect forms of Greek sculpture. We may, for instance,
summon to our mind the Endymion of the Capitol, nodding in
eternal slumber, with his sheep-dog slumbering by: or Artemis
stepping from her car; her dragons coil themselves between the
shafts and fold their plumeless wings: or else Hippolytus and
Meleager booted for the boar-chase: or Bacchus finding Ariadne
by the sea-shore; m&aelig;nads and satyrs are arrested in their dance;
flower-garland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>s fall upon the path; or a goat-legged satyr teaches
a young faun to play; the pipe and flute are there, and from the
boy's head fall long curls upon his neck. Or Europa drops anemone
and crocus from her hand, trembling upon the bull as he
swims onward through the sea: or tritons blow wreathed shells,
and dolphins splash the water: or the eagle's claws clasp Ganymede,
and bear him up to Zeus: or Adonis lies wounded, and wild
Aphrodite spreads hungry arms, and wails with rent robes tossed
above her head. From the cabinet of gems we draw a Love, blind,
bound, and stung by bees; or a girl holding an apple in her hand;
or a young man tying on his sandal. Then there is the Praxitelean
genius of the Vatican who might be Hylas, or Uranian Eros,
or Hymen&aelig;us, or curled Hyacinthus&mdash;- the faun who lies at Munich
overcome with wine, his throat bare, and his deep chest heaving
with the breath of sleep&mdash;Hercules strangling the twin snakes
in his cradle, or ponderous with knotty sinews and huge girth of
neck&mdash;Demeter, holding fruits of all sorts in one hand and cornstalks
in the other, sweeping her full raiment on the granary floor.
Or else we bring again the pugilist from Caracalla's bath&mdash;bruised
faces and ears livid with unheeded blows&mdash;their strained arms
bound with thongs, and clamps of iron on their fists. Processions
move in endless line, of godlike youths on prancing steeds, of
women bearing baskets full of cakes and flowers, of oxen lowing
to the sacrifice. The Trojan heroes fall with smiles upon their
lips; the athlete draws the strigil down his arm; the sons of
Niobe lie stricken, beautiful in death. Cups, too, and vases help
us, chased with figures of all kinds&mdash;dance, festival, love-making,
rustic sacrifice, the legendary tales of hate and woe, the daily idyls
of domestic life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are some of the works of Greek art which we may use in
our attempt to realize Theocritus. Nor need we neglect the monuments
of modern painting&mdash;Giorgione's pastoral pictures of piping
men and maidens crowned with jasmine-flowers, Raphael's
Triumph of Galatea, and Tintoretto's Marriage of Ariadne, or the
Arcadians of Poussin reading the tale of death upon the gravestone,
and its epitaph&mdash;"Et ego."</p>

<p>To reconstruct the mode of life of the Theocritean <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> is not a matter of much difficulty. Pastoral habits are
singularly unchangeable, and nothing strikes us more than the recurrence
of familiar rustic proverbs, superstitions, and ways of
thinking which we find in the idyllic poets. The mixture of simplicity
and shrewdness, of prosaic interest in worldly affairs and
of an unconscious admiration for the poetry of nature, which
George Sand has recently assigned with delicate analysis to the
bucolic character in her Idyls of Nohant, meets us in every line
of the Sicilian pastorals. On the Mediterranean shores, too, the
same occupations have been carried on for centuries with little
interruption. The same fields are being ploughed, the same vineyards
tilled, the same olive-gardens planted, as those in which
Theocritus played as a child. The rocks on which he saw old
Olpis watching for the tunnies, with fishing-reed and rush basket
are still haunted through sunny hours by patient fishermen. Perhaps
they cut their reeds and rushes in the same river-beds; certainly
they use the same sort of &#954;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;. The goats have not
forgotten to crop cytisus and myrtle, nor have the goatherds
changed their shaggy trousers and long crooks. You may still
pick out a shepherd lad among a hundred by his skin a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>nd cloak.
It is even said that the country ditties of the Neapolitans are
Greek; and how ancient is the origin of local superstitions who
shall say? The country folk still prefer, like Comatas in the fifth
idyl, garden-grown roses to the wild eglantine and anemones of
the hedgerow, scorning what has not required some cost or trouble
for its cultivation. Gretchen's test of love by blowing on
thistle-down does not differ much from that of the shepherd in
the third idyl. Live blood in the eye is still a sign of mysterious
importance (Idyl iii. 36). To spit is still a remedy against the
evil eye (vii. 39). Eunica, the town girl, still turns up her nose
at the awkward cowherd; city and country are not yet wholly
harmonized by improved means of locomotion. Then the people
of the South are perfectly unchanged&mdash;the fisher boys of Castellamare;
the tall, straight girls of Capri singing as they walk with
pitchers on their heads and distaffs in their hands; the wild Apulian
shepherds; the men and maidens laughing in the olive-fields
or vineyards; the black-browed beauties of the Cornice trooping
to church on Sundays with gold earrings, and with pink tulip-buds
in their dark hair. One thing, however, is greatly altered.
Go where we will, we find no statues of Priapus and the Nymphs.
No lambs are sacrificed to Pan. No honey or milk is poured
upon the altars of the rustic muse. The temples are in ruins.
Aloes and cactuses have invaded the colonnades of Girgenti, and
through the halls of P&aelig;stum winds whistle and sunbeams stream
unheeded. But though the gods are gone, men remain unaltered.
A little less careless, a little more superstitious they may be; but
their joys and sorrows, their vices and virtues, their loves and
hates, are still the same.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>Such reflections are trite and commonplace. Yet who can resist
the force of their truth and pathos?</p>

<p>said Theocritus, looking back into the far past, and remembering
that the gifts of love and beauty have belonged to men and gods
from everlasting. With what redoubled force may we, after the
lapse of twenty centuries, echo these words, when we tread the
ground he knew and read the songs he sang! His hills stir our
vague and yearning admiration, his sea laughs its old laugh of
waywardness and glee, his flowers bloom yearly, and fade in the
spring, his pine and olive branches overshadow us; we listen to
the bleating of his goats, and taste the sweetness of the spring
from which he drank; the milk and honey are as fresh upon our
lips, the wine in winter by the wood fire, when the winds are loud
is just as fragrant; youth is still youth, nor have the dark-eyed
maidens lost their charm. Truly &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#7937;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8048;
&#966;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7974;&#956;&#949;&#962;. In this consists the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> Theocritean poetry.
It strikes a note which echoes through our hearts by reason of its
genuine simplicity and pathos. The thoughts which natural beauty
stirs in our minds find their embodiment in his sweet, strong
verse; and though since his time the world has grown old, though
the gods of Greece have rent their veils and fled with shrieks from
their sanctuaries, though in spite of ourselves we turn our faces
skyward from the earth, though emaciated saints and martyrs
have supplanted Adonis and the Graces, though the cold, damp
shades of Calvinism have chilled our marrow and our blood, yet
there remain deep down within our souls some primal sympathies
with nature, some instincts of the faun or satyr or sylvan, which
education has not quite eradicated. "The hand which hath long
time held a violet doth not soon forego her perfume, nor the cup
from which sweet wine had flowed his fragrance."</p>

<p>I have dwelt long upon the peculiar properties of classical landscape
as described by the Greek idyllists, and as they still exist
for travellers upon the more sheltered shores of the Mediterranean,
because it is necessary to understand them before we can appreciate
the <i>truth</i> of Theocritus. Of late years much has been written
about the difference between classical and modern ways of regarding
landscape. Mr. Ruskin has tried to persuade us that the
ancients only cared for the more cultivated parts of nature, for
gardens or orchards, from which food or profit or luxurious pleasure
might be derived. And in this view there is no doubt some
truth. The Greeks and Romans paid far less attention to inanimate
nature than we do, and were beyond all question repelled by
the savage grandeur of marine and mountain scenery, preferring
landscapes of smiling and cultivated beauty to rugged sublimity
or the picturesqueness of dec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ay. In this they resembled all Southern
nations. An Italian of the present day avoids ruinous places
and solitudes however splendid. Among the mountains he complains
of the <i>brutto paese</i> in which he has to live, and is always
longing for town gayeties and the amenities of civilized society.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
The ancients, again, despised all interests that pretended to
rival the paramount interest of civic or military life. Seneca's figurative
expression <i>circum flosculos occupatur</i> might be translated
literally as applied to a trifler to denote the scorn which thinkers,
statesmen, patriots, and generals of Greece and Rome felt for mere
rural prettiness; while Quintilian's verdict on Theocritus (whom,
however, he allows to be <i>admirabilis in suo genere</i>), <i>musa illa
rustica et pastoralis non forum modo verum ipsam etiam urbem
reformidat</i>, characterizes the insensibility of urban intellects to a
branch of art which we consider of high importance. But it is
very easy to overstrain this view, and Mr. Ruskin, perhaps, has
laid an undue stress on Homer in his criticism of the classics,
whereas it is among the later Greek and Roman poets that the
analogy of modern literature would lead us to expect indications
of a genuine taste for unadorned nature. These signs the idyllic
poets amply supply; but in seeking for them we must be prepared
to recognize a very different mode of expression from that
which we are used to in the florid poets of the modern age.
Conciseness, simplicity, and an almost prosaic accuracy are the
never-failing attributes of classical descriptive art. Moreover, humanity
was always more present to their minds than to ours.
Nothing evoked sympathy from a Greek unless it appeared before
him in a human shape, or in connection with some human sentiment.
The ancient poets do not describe inanimate nature as
such, or attribute a vague spirituality to fields and clouds. That
feeling for the beauty of the world which is embodied in such
poems as Shelley's <i>Ode to the West Wind</i> gave birth in their imagination
to definite legends, involving some dramatic interest and
conflict of passions. We who are apt to look for rhapsodies and
brilliant outpourings of eloquent fancy can scarcely bring ourselves
to reco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>llect what a delicate sense of nature and what profound
emotions are implied in the conceptions of Pan and Hyacinthus
and Galatea. The misuse which has been made of mythology
by modern writers has effaced half its vigor and charm. It
is only by returning to the nature which inspired these myths
that we can reconstruct their exquisite vitality. Different ages
and nations express themselves by different forms of art. Music
appears to be dominant in the present period; sculpture ruled
among the Greeks, and struck the key-note for all other arts.
Even those sentiments which in our mind are most vague, the admiration
of sunset skies, or flowers or copsewoods in spring, were
expressed by them in the language of definite human form. They
sought to externalize and realize as far as possible, not to communicate
the inmost feelings and spiritual suggestions arising out of
natural objects. Never advancing beyond corporeal conditions,
they confined themselves to form, and sacrificed the charm of
mystery, which is incompatible with very definite conception. It
was on this account that sculpture, the most exactly imitative of
the arts, became literally architectonic among the Greeks. And
for a precisely similar reason music, which is the most abstract
and subjective of the arts, the most evanescent in its material, and
the vaguest, assumes the chief rank among modern arts. Sculpture
is the poetry of the body, music the language of the soul.</p>

<p>Having once admitted their peculiar <i>mode</i> of feeling Nature, no
one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>can deny that landscape occupies an important place in Greek
literature. Every line of Theocritus is vital with a strong passion
for natural beauty, incarnated in myths. But even in descriptive
poetry he is not deficient. His list of trees and flowers is long,
and the epithets with which they are characterized are very exquisite&mdash;not,
indeed, brilliant with the inbreathed fancy of the
North, but so perfectly appropriate as to define the special beauty
of the flower or tree selected. In the same way, a whole scene is
conveyed in a few words by mere conciseness of delineation, or by
the artful introduction of some incident suggesting human emotion.
Take for example this picture of the stillness of the night:</p>

</p>

<p>Or the sea-weeds on a rocky shore (vii. 58), or the summer bee
(iii. 15), or the country party at harvest time (vii. 129 to the
end). In all of these a peculiar simplicity will be noticed, a self-restraint
and scrupulosity of definite delineation. To Theocritus
the shadowy and iridescent fancies of modern poetry would have
been unintelligible. The creations of a Keats or Shelley would
have appeared to be monstrous births, like the Centaurs of Ixion,
begotten by lawless imaginations upon cloud and mist. When
the Greek poet wished to express the charm of summer waves he
spoke of Galatea, more fickle and light than thistle-down, a maiden
careless of her lover and as cruel as the sea. The same waves
suggested to Shakespeare these lines, from <i>Midsummer-Night's
Dream</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Thou rememberest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That the rude sea grew civil at her song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And certain stars shot madly from their spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the sea-maid's music;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and to Weber the ethereal "mermaid's song" in <i>Oberon</i>. No one
acquainted with Shakespeare and Weber can deny that both have
expressed with marvellous subtlety the magic of the sea in its enchanting
calm, whereas the Greek poet works only by indirect
suggestion, and presents us with a human portrait more than a
phantom of the glamour of the deep. What we have lost in definite
projection we have gained in truth, variety, and freedom.
The language of our art appeals immediately to the emotions, disclosing
the spiritual reality of things, and caring less for their
form than for the feelings they excite in us. Greek art remains
upon the surface, and translates into marble the humanized aspects
of the external world. The one is forever seeking to set
free, the other to imprison, thought. The Greek tells with exquisite
precision what he has observed, investing it perhaps with
his own emotion. He says, for instance:</p>

<p>The modern poet, to use Shelley's words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Will watch from dawn to gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lake-reflected sun illume<br /></span>

<p>endeavoring to look through and beyond the objects of the outer
world, to use them as the starting-points for his creative fancy,
and to embroider their materials with the dazzling <i>fioriture</i> of his
invention. Metamorphosis existed for the Greek poet as a simple
fact. If the blood of Adonis turned to anemones, yet the actual
drops of blood and the flowers remained distinct in the poet's
mind; and even though he may have been sceptical about the
miracle, he restrained his fancy to the reproduction of the one old
fable. The modern poet believes in no metamorphosis but that
which is produced by the alchemy of his own brain. He loves to
confound the most dissimilar existences, and to form startling
combinations of thoughts which have never before been brought
into connection with each other. Uncontrolled by tradition or
canons of propriety, he roams through the world, touching its various
objects with the wand of his imagination. To the west
wind he cries:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels of rain and lightning; there are spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the blue surface of thine airy surge,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like the bright hair uplifted from the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some fierce M&aelig;nad, e'en from the dim verge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the horizon to the zenith's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The locks of the approaching storm....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Imagine how astonished even &AElig;schylus would have been at
these violent transitions and audacious transformations. The
Greeks had few conceits:<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> they did not call the waves "nodding
hearse-plumes" like Calderon, or the birds "winged lyres" like
Marini, or daisies "pearled Arcturi of the earth" like Shelley, or
laburnums "dropping wells of fire" like Tennyson. If they ventured
on such licenses in their more impassioned lyrics, they
maintained the metaphor with strict propriety. One good instance
of the difference in this respect between the two ages is
afforded by Ben Jonson, who translates Sappho's</p>

<p>by "the dear glad angel of the spring, the nightingale." Between
&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962; and <i>angel</i> there is the distance of nearly twenty
centuries; for though Ben Jonson may have meant merely to
Anglicize the Greek word, he could not but have been glad of the
more modern meaning.</p>

<p>So much of this essay has already been devoted to the consideration
of Theocritean poetry in general that I cannot here afford
to enter into the details of his several idyls. A few, however,
may be noticed of peculiar beauty and significance. None are
more true to local scenery than those which relate to the story of
Galatea. In this brief tale, the life o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>f the mountains and the
rivers and the sea is symbolized&mdash;the uncouth and gigantic hills
rude in their rusticity; the clear and lovable stream; the merry
sea, inconstant and treacherous, with shifting waves. The mountain
stands forever unremoved; love as he will, he can but gaze
upon the dancing sea, and woo it with gifts of hanging trees, and
cool shadowy caverns, and still sleeping-places in sheltered bays.
But the stream leaps down from crag to crag, and gathers strength
and falls into the arms of the expectant nymph&mdash;a fresh lover
fair and free, and full of smiles. Supposing this marriage of the
sea and river to have been the earliest idea of the mythus, in
course of time the persons of Acis and Galatea, and the rejected
lover Polyphemus, became more and more humanized, until the
old symbolism was lost in a pastoral romance. Polyphemus
loves, but never wins: he may offer his tall bay-trees and slender
cypresses and black ivy and sweet-fruited vines and cold water
flowing straight&mdash;a drink divine&mdash;from the white snows of wooded
&AElig;tna; he may sit whole days above the sea, and gaze upon the
smiling waves, and tell the nymph of all his flocks and herds, and
lure her with promises of flowers and fawns and bear's whelps, to
leave the sea to beat upon its shore and come and live with him,
and feed his sheep. It is of no use. Galatea heeds him not, and
Polyphemus has to shepherd his love as best he can. Poetry
in this idyl is blended with the simplest country humor. The
path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>os of Polyphemus is really touching, and his allusions to the
sweetness of a shepherd's life among the hills abound in unconscious
poetry, side by side with which are placed the most ludicrous
expressions of uncouth disappointment, together with shrewd
observations on the value of property and other prosaic details.
If I mistake not, this is true of the rustic character, in which,
though stirred by sorrow into sympathy with nature, habitual
caution and shrewdness survive. The meditations of the shepherd
in the third idyl exhibit the same mixture of sentiments.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the idyls which illustrate town life I select
the second, the humor of its rival, the fifteenth, being of that perfect
sort which must be read and laughed over, but which cannot
well be analyzed. The subject of the <i>Pharmaceutria</i> is an incantation
performed in the stillness of the night by a proud Syracusan
lady who has been deserted by her lover. In delineating
the fierceness of her passion and the indomitable resolution of her
will Theocritus has produced a truly tragic picture. Sim&aelig;tha,
maddened by vehement despair, resorts to magic arts. Love, she
says, has sucked her life-blood like a leech, and parched her with
the fever of desire. She cannot live without the lover for whose
possession she has sacrificed her happiness and honor. If she
cannot charm him back again, she will kill him. There are
poisons ready to work her will in the last resort. Meanwhile we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
see her standing at the magic wheel, turning it round before the
fire, and charging it to draw false Delphis to her home. A hearth
with coals upon it is at hand, on which her maid keeps sprinkling
the meal that typifies the bones of Delphis, the wax by which his
heart is to be consumed, and the laurel-bough that stands for his
body. At the least sign of laziness Sim&aelig;tha scolds her with hard
and haughty words. She stands like a Medea, seeking no sympathy,
sparing no reproaches, tiger-like in her ferocity of thwarted
passion. When the magic rites have been performed, and Thestylis
has gone to smear an ointment on the doors of Delphis,
Sim&aelig;tha leaves the wheel and addresses her soliloquy to the Moon,
who has just risen, and who is journeying in calm and silver glory
through the night. There is something sublime in the contrast
between the moonlight on the sea of Syracuse and the fierce
agony of the deserted lioness. To the Moon she confides the
story of her love: "Take notice of my love, whence it arose,
dread Queen." It is a vivid and tragic tale of Southern passion:
sudden and consuming, recklessly gratified, and followed by desertion
on the one side and by vengeance on the other.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Sim&aelig;tha
has no doubt many living parallels among Sicilian women. The
classical reader will find in her narration a description of the
working of love hardly to be surpassed by Sappho's Ode or
Plato's <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>. The wildness of the scene, the magic rites, the
augu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>st presence of the Moon, and the murderous determination of
Sim&aelig;tha heighten the dramatic effect, and render the tale excessively
interesting.</p>

<p>As a picture of classical sorcery this idyl is very curious.
Nothing can be more erroneous than to imagine that witchcraft
is a Northern invention of the Middle Ages, or that the Brocken is
its headquarters. With the exception of a few inconsiderable
circumstances, all the terrible or loathsome rites of magic were
known to the ancients, and merely copied by the moderns. Circe
in Homer, Sim&aelig;tha in Theocritus, Canidia in Horace, the Libyan
sorceress of Virgil, the Saga of Tibullus, Medea in Ovid, Erichtho
in Lucan, and Meg&aelig;ra in Claudian (to mention no more), make
up a list of formidable witches to whom none of the hideous details
of the black art were unknown. They sought for poisonous
herbs at night; lived in ruinous places; ransacked charnel-houses
for dead bodies; killed little children to obtain their fat for unguents;
compelled the spirits of the dead to rise, and, after entering
a fresh corpse, to reveal the mysteries of fate; devoured snakes;
drank blood; raised storms at sea; diverted the moon from her
course; muttered spells of fearful import; and loved above all
things to "raise jars, jealousies, strifes, like a thick scurf o'er life."
Even in the minutest details of sorcery they anticipated the witches
of the Middle Ages. Hypsipyle in Ovid mentions a waxen portrait
stuck full of needles, and so fashioned as to waste the life of
its original. The witch in the <i>Golden Ass</i> of Apuleius anoints
herself, and flies about like a bird at night. Nor w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>ere were-wolves,
those most ghastly creations of diseased imagination, unfamiliar
to the Greeks and Romans, as may be proved from Herodotus,
Virgil, Ovid, Petronius, and Apuleius. Those who care to pursue
this subject will find a vast amount of learning collected on the
point by Ben Jonson in his annotations to <i>The Masque of Queens</i>.
One fact, however, must be always borne in mind: the ancients
regarded witchcraft either as a hideous or a solemn exercise of supernatural
power, not recognizing any Satanic agency or compact
with Hell. <i>Hecate triviis ululata per urbes</i>, the "Queen of the
Night and of the Tombs," assisted sorcerers; but this meant
merely that they trafficked in the dark with the foul mysteries of
death and corruption. The classical witches were either grave
and awful women, like the Libyan priestess in the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, or else
loathsome pariahs, terrible for their malignity, like Lucan's Erichtho.
Medi&aelig;valism added a deeper horror to this superstitious
and ghoulish conception by the thoughts of spiritual responsibility
and of league with God's enemies. Damnation was the price
of magic power; witchcraft being not merely abominable in the
eyes of men, but also unpardonable at the bar of divin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>e justice.</p>

<p>Several poems of Theocritus are written on the theme of Doric
chivalry, and illustrate the heroic age of Greece. They may be
compared to the <i>Idyls of the King</i>, for their excellence consists
in the consummate art with which episodes from the legendary
cycles of a bygone age are wrought into polished pictures by a
cultivated poet. The thirteenth idyl is especially remarkable for
the exquisite finish of its style and also for the light it throws
on the mutual relations of knight and squire in early Greek warfare.
Theocritus chooses for the subject of this poem an episode
in the life of Herakles, the Dorian hero, when he and other foremost
men of Hellas, &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7969;&#961;&#8061;&#969;&#957;, followed Jason in the Argo
to the Colchian shores, and he took young Hylas with him; "for
even," says Theocritus, "the brazen-hearted son of Amphitryon,
who withstood the fierceness of the lion, loved a youth, the charming
Hylas, and taught him like a father everything by which he
might become a good and famous man; nor would he leave the
youth at dawn or noon or evening, but sought continually to
fashion him after his own heart, and to make him a right yoke-fellow
with him in mighty deeds." How he lost Hylas on the
Cianian shore, and in the wildness of his sorrow let Argo sail
without him, and endured the reproach of desertion, is well known.
Theocritus has wrought the story with more than his accustomed
elegance. But I wish to confine attention to the ideal of knighthood
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>knightly education presented in the passage quoted.
Herakles was not merely the lover, but the guardian also and tutor,
of Hylas. He regarded him not only as an object of tenderness,
but also as a future friend and helper in the business of life. His
constant aim was to form of him a brave and manly warrior, a
Herculean hero. And in this respect Herakles was the eponym
and patron of an order which existed throughout Doric Hellas.
This order, protected by religious tradition and public favor, regulated
by strict rules, and kept within the limits of honor, produced
the Cretan lovers, the Laced&aelig;monian "hearers" and "inspirers,"
the Theban immortals who lay with faces turned so
stanchly to their foes that vice seemed incompatible with so much
valor. Achilles was another eponym of this order. In the twenty-ninth
idyl, the phrase &#7944;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#955;&#8053;&#970;&#959;&#953; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#953; is used to describe the
most perfect pair of manly friends. The twelfth idyl is written
in a similar if a weaker and more wanton vein. The same longing
retrospect is cast upon the old days "when men indeed were
golden, when the love of comrades was mutual," and constancy is
rewarded with the same promise of glorious immortality as that
which Plato holds out in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>. Bion, we may remark in
passing, celebrates with equal praise the friendships of Theseus,
Ores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>tes, and Achilles. Without taking some notice of this peculiar
institution, in its origin military and austere, it is impossible
to understand the chivalrous age of Greece among the Dorian
tribes. In the midst of brute force and cunning, and an almost
absolute disregard of what we are accustomed to understand by
chivalry&mdash;gentleness, chastity, truth, regard for women and weak
persons&mdash;this one anomalous sentiment emerges.</p>

<p>Passing to another point in which Greek differed from medi&aelig;val
chivalry, we notice the semi-divine nature of the heroes: &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#962;
&#7940;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; is the name by which they are designated, and supernatural
favor is always showered upon them. This indicates a primitive
society, a national consciousness ignorant of any remote past.
The heroes whom Theocritus celebrates are purely Dorian&mdash;Herakles,
a Jack the Giant-Killer in his cradle, brawny, fearless, of
huge appetite, a mighty trainer, with a scowl to frighten athletes
from the field; Polydeuces, a notable bruiser; Castor, a skilled
horseman and a man of blood. In one point the twin sons of
Leda resembled medi&aelig;val knights. They combined the arts of
song with martial prowess. Theocritus styles them &#7985;&#960;&#960;&#8134;&#949;&#962; &#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#8055;,
&#7936;&#949;&#952;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#962; &#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#8055;&mdash;harp-playing riders of horses, athlete
poets. Their achievements, narrated in the twenty-second idyl,
may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>be compared with those of Tristram and Lancelot. The gigantic
warrior whom they find by the well in the land of the
Bebrycians, gorgeously armed, insolent, and as knotty as a brazen
statue, who refuses access to the water and challenges them to
combat, exactly resembles one of the lawless giants of the <i>Mort
d'Arthur</i>. The courtesy of the Greek hero contrasts well with the
barbarian's violence; and when they come to blows, it is good to
observe how address, agility, training, nerve, enable Polydeuces to
overcome with ease the vast fury and brute strength of the Bebrycian
bully. As the fight proceeds, the son of Leda improves in
flesh and color, while Amycus gets out of breath, and sweats his
thews away. Polydeuces pounds the giant's neck and face, reducing
him to a hideous mass of bruises, and receiving the blows
of Amycus upon his chest and loins. At the end of the fight
he spares his prostrate foe, on the condition of his respecting
the rites of hospitality and dealing courteously with strangers.
Throughout it will be noticed how carefully Theocritus maintains
the conception of the Hellenic as distinguished from the
barbarian combatant. Christian and pagan are not more distinct
in a legend of the San Graal. But Greek chivalry has no magic,
no monstrous exaggeration. All is simple, natural, and human.
Bellerophon, it is true, was sent after the Chim&aelig;ra, and Perseus
freed Andromeda like St. George from a dragon's mouth. But
these fancies of Greek infancy formed no integral part of artistic
mythology; instead of being multiplied, they were gradually winnowed
out, and the poets laid but little stress upon them.</p>

<p>The achievement of Castor is not so favorable to the character
of Hellenic chivalry. Having in concert with Polydeuces borne
off by guile the daughters of Leucippus from their affianced husbands,
Castor kills one of the injured lovers who pursues him and
demands restitution. He slays him, though he is his own first
cousin, ruthlessly; and while the other son of Aphareus is rushing
forward to avenge his brother's death, Zeus hurls lightning
and destroys him. Theocritus remarks that it is no light matter
to engage in battle with the Tyndarids; but he makes no reflection
on what we should call "the honor" of the whole transaction.</p>

<p>Of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>ll the purely pastoral idyls by which Theocritus is most
widely famous, perhaps the finest is the seventh, or Thalysia. It
glows with the fresh and radiant splendor of Southern beauty.
In this poem the idyllist describes the journey of three young
men in summer from the city to the farm of their friend Phrasidamus,
who has asked them to take part in the feast with which
he proposes to honor Demeter at harvest-time. On their way
they meet with a goatherd, Lycidas, who invites them, "with a
smiling eye," to recline beneath the trees and while away the
hours of noontide heat with song. "The very lizard," he says,
"is sleeping by the wall; but on the hard stones of the footpath
your heavy boots keep up a ceaseless ringing." Thus chided by
the goatherd they resolve upon a singing-match between Simichidas,
the teller of the tale, and Lycidas, who offers his crook as the
prize of victory. Lycidas begins the contest with that exquisite
song to Ageanax, which has proved the despair of all succeeding
idyllists, and which furnished Virgil with one of the most sonorous
lines in his <i>Georgics</i>. No translation can do justice to the
smooth and liquid charm of its melodious verse, in which the tenderest
feeling mingles gracefully with delicate humor and with
homely descriptions of a shepherd's life. The following lines,
forming a panegyric on Comatas, some famed singer of the rustic
muse, may be quoted for their pure Greek feeling. Was ever an
unlucky mortal envied more melodiously, and yet more quaintly,
for his singular fortune?</p>

<p>The song with which Simichidas contends against his rival is not
of equal beauty; but the goatherd hands him the crook "as a
gift of friendship from the Muses." Then he leaves the three
friends, who resume their journey till they reach the house of
Phrasidamus. There elms and poplar-trees and vines embower
them with the pleasant verdure of rustling leaves and the perfumes
of summer flowers and autumn fruits. The jar of wine as
sweet as that which made the Cyclops dance among his sheepfold
spreads its fragrance through the air; while the statue of Demeter,
with her handfuls of corn and poppy-heads, stands smiling by.</p>

<p>This seventh idyl, of which no adequate idea can be conveyed
by mere description, may serve as the type of those purely rustic
poems which since the days of Theocritus have from age to age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>been imitated by versifiers emulous of his gracefulness. If space
allowed, it would not be uninteresting to analyze the idyl of the
two old fishermen, who gossip together so wisely and contentedly
in their hut by the sea-shore, mending their nets the while, and
discoursing gravely of their dreams. In this idyl, which is, however,
possibly the work of one of Theocritus's imitators, and in
the second, which consists of a singing-match between two harvest-men,
the native homeliness of the idyllic muse appears to best
advantage.</p>

<p>With this brief and insufficient notice I must leave Theocritus
in order to say a few words about his successors. Bion's poetry,
when compared with that of Theocritus, declines considerably
from the bucolic type. His idyls are for the most part fragments
of delicately finished love-songs, remarkable for elegance
and sweetness more than for masculine vigor or terse expression.
In Bion the artificial style of pastoral begins. Theocritus had
made cows and pipes and shepherds fashionable. His imitators
followed him, without the humor and natural taste which rendered
his pictures so attractive. We already trace the frigid affectation
of bucolic interest in the elegy on Bion: "He sang no song
of wars or tears, but piped of Pan and cowherds, and fed flocks,
singing as he went; pipes he fashioned, and milked the sweet-breathed
heifer, and taught kisses, and cherished in his bosom
love, and stole the heart of Aphrodite." As it happens, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
original and powerful of Bion's remaining poems is a "Song of
Tears," of passionate lamentation, of pathetic grief, composed, not
as a pastoral ditty, but on the occasion of one of those splendid
festivals in which the Syrian rites of slain Adonis were celebrated
by Greek women. The &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#8049;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7944;&#948;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#962; is written with a fiery
passion and a warmth of coloring peculiar to Bion. The verse
bounds with tiger leaps, its full-breathed dactyls panting with the
energy of rapid flight. The tender and reflective beauty of Theocritus,
the concentrated passion of his Sim&aelig;tha, and the flowing
numbers of his song to Adonis are quite lost and swallowed up
in the Asiatic fury of Bion's lament. The poem begins with the
cry &#913;&#7984;&#8049;&#950;&#969; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7948;&#948;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#957;, which is variously repeated in idyllic fashion
as a refrain throughout the lamentation.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> After the prelude,
having, as it were, struck the key-note to the music, the singer
cries:</p>

<p>Notice how the long words follow one another with quick pulses
and flashes of sound. The same peculiar rhythm recurs when, after
describing the beautiful dead body of Adonis, the poet returns
to Aphrodite:</p>

<p>There are few passages of poetical imagery more striking than
this picture of the queen of beauty tearing through the forest,
heedless of her tender limbs and useless charms, and calling on
her Syrian lover. What follows is even more passionate; after
some lines of mere description, the ecstasy again descends upon
the poet, and he bursts into the wildest of most beautiful laments:</p>

<p>The last few lines of her soliloquy are exquisitely touching, especially
those in which Aphrodite deplores her immortality, and acknowledges
the supremacy of the queen of the grave over Love
and Beauty. What follows is pitched at a lower key. There is
too much of merely Anacreontic prettiness about the description
of the bridal bed and the lamenting Loves. Aphrodite's passion
reminds us of a Neapolitan <i>Stabat Mater</i>, in which the frenzy of
love and love-like piety are strangely blended. But the concluding
picture suggests nothing nobler than a painting of Albano, in
which <i>amoretti</i> are plentiful, and there is much elegance of composition.
This remark applies to the rest of Bion's poetry. If
Theocritus deserves to be illustrated by the finest of Greek bass-reliefs,
Bion cannot claim more than an exquisitely chiselled gem.
Certainly the second and third fragments are very charming; and
the lines to Hesper (fragment 16) have so much beauty that I attempt
a version of them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hesper, thou golden light of happy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hesper, thou holy pride of purple eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moon among stars, but star beside the moon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Love is my goal, and Love how fair it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When friend meets friend sole in the silent night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest, Hesper!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Moschus we find less originality and power than belong to
Bion. His <i>Europa</i> is an imitation of the style in which Theocritus
wrote <i>Hylas</i>; but the copy is frigid and affected by the
size of its model. Five-and-twenty lines for instance are devoted
to an elaborate description of a basket, which leaves no very definite
impression on the mind;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> whereas every leaf and tendril on
the cup which Theocritus introduces into the first idyl stands out
vividly before us. Nothing, moreover, could be more unnatural
and tedious than the long speech which Europa makes when she
is being carried out to sea upon the bull's back. Yet we must
allow that there is spirit and beauty in the triumph of sea monsters
who attend Poseidon and do honor to the chosen bride of
Zeus; Nereids riding on dolphins, and Tritons, "the deep-voiced
minstrels of the sea, sounding a marriage-song on their long-winding
conchs."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The whole of this piece is worthy of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
Moschus is remarkable for occasional felicities of
language. In this line, for example,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#949;&#8022;&#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#8051;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7956;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#8000;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#969;&#957;,<br /></span>

<p>an old thought receives new and subtle beauty by its expression.
If <i>Megara</i> (Idyl iv.) be really the work of Moschus, which is
doubtful, it reflects more honor on him. The dialogue between
the wife and mother of the maddened Herakles, after he has murdered
his children and gone forth to execute fresh labors, is worthy
of their tragic situation. &#7964;&#961;&#969;&#962; &#948;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#8051;&#964;&#951;&#962; (Runaway Love),
again, is an exquisite little poem in the Anacreontic style of Bion,
fully equal to any of its models. The fame of Moschus will, however,
depend upon the elegy on Bion. I have already hinted that
its authorship is questioned. In my opinion it far surpasses any
of his compositions in respect of definite thought and original
imagination. Though the bucolic commonplaces are used with
obvious artificiality, and much is borrowed from Theocritus's <i>Lament
for Daphnis</i>, yet so true and delicate a spirit is inbreathed
into the old forms as to render them quite fresh. The passage
which begins &#945;&#7984; &#945;&#7984; &#964;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#945;&#955;&#8049;&#967;&#945;&#953; every dabbler in Greek literature
knows by heart. And what can be more ingeniously pathetic
than the <i>nuances</i> of feeling expressed in these lines?</p>

<p>and in the allusion made to the Sicilian girlhood of grim Persephone
(126-129). This vein of tender and melodious sentiment,
which verges on the <i>concetti</i> of modern art, seems different
from the style of <i>Europa</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>
<p>To English readers, the three elegies, on Daphnis, on Adonis,
and on Bion, severally attributed to Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus,
will always be associated with the names of Milton and
Shelley. There is no comparison whatever between Lycidas and
Daphnis. In spite of the misplaced apparition of St. Peter, and
of the frigidity which belongs to pastoral allegory, Lycidas is a
richer and more splendid monument of elegiac verse. The simplicity
of the Theocritean dirge contrasts strangely with the varied
wealth of Milton's imagery, the few ornaments of Greek art
with the intricate embroideries of modern fancy. To quote passages
from these well-known poems would be superfluous; but let
a student of literature compare the passages &#960;&#8119; &#960;&#959;&#954;' &#7940;&#961;' &#7974;&#963;&#952;' and
&#8038; &#928;&#8049;&#957; &#928;&#8049;&#957; with Milton's paraphrase "Where were ye, nymphs&mdash;,"
or the concise paragraphs about the flowers and valleys that mourned
for Daphnis with the luxuriance of Milton's invocation "Return,
Alpheus."</p>

<p>When Shelley wrote <i>Adonais</i> his mind was full of the elegies
on Bion and Adonis. Of direct translation in his Lament there
is very little; but he has absorbed both of the Greek poems, and
transmuted them into the substance of his own mind. Urania
takes the place of Aphrodite&mdash;the heavenly queen, "most musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>of mourners," bewails the loss of her poetical consort. Instead
of loves, the couch of Adonais is surrounded by the thoughts
and fancies of which he was the parent; and, instead of gods and
goddesses, the power of nature is invoked to weep for him and
take him to herself. Whatever Bion and Moschus recorded as
a fact becomes, consistently with the spiritualizing tendency of
modern genius, symbolical in Shelley's poem. His art has alchemized
the whole structure, idealizing what was material and disembodying
the sentiments which were incarnated in simple images.
<i>Adonais</i> is a sublime rhapsody; its multitudinous ideas
are whirled like drops of golden rain, on which the sun of the
poet's fancy gleams with ever-changing rainbow hues. In drifts
and eddies they rush past, delighting us with their rapidity and
brilliancy; but the impression left upon our mind is vague and
incomplete, when compared with the few and distinct ideas presented
by the Doric elegies. At the end of <i>Alastor</i> there occurs
a touching reminiscence of Moschus, but the outline is less faint
than in <i>Adonais</i>, the transmutation even more complete.</p>

<p>Tennyson, among the poets of the nineteenth century, owes
much to the Greek idyllists. His genius appears to be in many
respects akin to theirs, and the age in which he lives is not unlike
the Ptolemaic period. Unfitted, perhaps, by temperament for the
most impassioned lyrics, he delights in minutely finished pictures,
in felicities of expression, and in subtle harmonies of verse. Like
Theocritus, he finds in nature and in the legends <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>of past ages subjects
congenial to his muse. <i>&#338;none</i> and <i>Tithonus</i> are steeped in
the golden beauty of Syracusan art. "Come down, O maid,"
transfers, with perfect taste, the Greek idyllic feeling to Swiss scenery;
it is a fine instance of new wine being poured successfully
into old bottles, for nothing can be fresher, and not even the
<i>Thalysia</i> is sweeter. It would be easy enough to collect minor
instances which prove that the laureate's mind is impregnated
with the thoughts and feelings of the poems I have been discussing.
For instance, both the figure "softer than sleep," and the
comparison of a strong man's muscles to the smooth rush of running
water over sunken stones, which we find in <i>Enid</i>, occur in
Theocritus.</p>

<p>At the end of this chapter I cannot refrain from once more
recommending all lovers of pure verse and perfect scenery to
study the Greek idyllists upon the shores of the Mediterranean.
Nor would it be possible to carry a better guide-book to the
statue-galleries of Rome and Naples. For in the verses of Theocritus,
Bion, and Moschus, the &aelig;sthetic principles of the Greeks, in
the age to which our relics of their statuary for the most part belong,
are feelingly and pithily expressed; while the cold marble,
that seems to require so many commentaries, receives from their
idyllic coloring new life.</p>

we find many very exquisite <i>concetti</i>. Philostratus, for example, from whom

Even Empedocles (see vol. i. p. 220) and Pindar (see vol. i. p. 369) are not
free from the vice of artificial metaphor. Compare, too, the labored metaphors

<p>The Anthology may from some points of view be regarded as
the most valuable relic of antique literature which we possess.
Composed of several thousand short poems, written for the most
part in the elegiac metre, at different times and by a multitude of
authors, it is coextensive with the whole current of Greek history,
from the splendid period of the Persian war to the decadence
of Christianized Byzantium. Many subjects of interest in Greek
life, which would otherwise have had to be laboriously illustrated
from the historians or the comic poets, are here fully and melodiously
set forth. If we might compare the study of Greek literature
to a journey in some splendid mountain region, then we
might say with propriety that from the sparkling summits where
&AElig;schylus and Sophocles and Pindar sit enthroned we turn in our
less strenuous moods to gather the meadow flowers of Meleager,
Palladas, Callimachus. Placing them between the leaves of the
book of our memory, we possess an everlasting treasure of sweet
thoughts, which will serve in after-days to remind us of those
scenes of Olympian majesty through which we travelled. The
slight effusions of these mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>nor poets are even nearer to our hearts
than the masterpieces of the noblest Greek literature. They treat
with a touching limpidity and sweetness of the joys and fears and
hopes and sorrows that are common to all humanity. They introduce
us to the actual life of a bygone civilization, stripped of
its political or religious accidents, and tell us that the Greeks of
Athens or of Sidon thought and felt exactly as we feel. Even
the <i>Graffiti</i> of Pompeii have scarcely more power to reconstruct
the past and summon as in dreams the voices and the forms of
long-since-buried men. There is yet another way in which the
Anthology brings us closer to the Greeks than any other portion
of their literature. The lyrists express an intense and exalted
mood of the race in its divine adolescence. The tragedians exhibit
the genius of Athens in its maturity. The idyllists utter a
rich nightingale note from the woods and fields of Sicily. But
the Anthology carries us through all the phases of Hellenic civilization
upon its uninterrupted undercurrent of elegiac melody.
The clear fresh light of the morning, the splendor of noonday,
the mellow tints of sunset, and the sad gray hues of evening are
all there. It is a tree which bears the leaves and buds and blossoms
and fruitage of the Greek spirit on its boughs at once. Many
intervals in the life of the nation which are represented by no other
portion of its literature&mdash;the ending, for example, of the first
century before Christ&mdash;here receive a brilliant illustration. Again,
there is no more signal proof of the cosmopolitan nature of the
later Greek culture than is afforded by the Anthology. From
Rome, Alexandria, Palestine, Byzantium, no less than from the
isles and continent of Greece, are recruited the poets, whose works
are enshrined in this precious golden treasury of fugitive pieces.</p>

<p>The history of the Anthology is not without interest. By a
gradual process of compilation and accretion it grew into its present
form from very slight beginnings. The first impulse to collect
epigrams seems to have originated in connection with arch&aelig;ology.
From the very earliest the Greeks were in the habit of
engraving sentences, for the most part in verse, upon their temples,
statues, trophies, tombs, and public monuments of all kinds.
Many of these inscriptions were used by Herodotus and Thucydides
as authorities for facts and dates. But about 200 B.C. one
Polemon made a general collection of the authentic epigrams to
be found upon the public buildings of the Gr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>eek cities. After
him Alcetas copied the dedicatory verses at Delphi. Similar collections
are ascribed to Mnestor and Apellas Ponticus. Aristodemus
is mentioned as the compiler of the epigrams of Thebes.
Philochorus performed the same service for Athens. Neoptolemus
of Paros and the philosopher Euhemerus are also credited
with similar antiquarian labors. So far, the collectors of epigrams
had devoted themselves to historical monuments; and of
their work, in any separate form at least, no trace exists. But
Meleager of Gadara (B.C. 60) conceived the notion of arranging
in alphabetical order a selection of lyric and erotic poetry, which
he dedicated to his friend Diocles. He called this compilation
by the name of &#963;&#964;&#8051;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;, or wreath, each of the forty-six poets
whom he admitted into his book being represented by a flower.
Philip of Thessalonica, in the time of Trajan, following his example,
incorporated into the garland of Meleager those epigrams
which had acquired celebrity in the interval. About the same
time or a little later, Straton of Sardis made a special anthology
of poems on one class of subjects, which is known as the &#956;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;
&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#8053;, and into which, besides ninety-eight of his own epigrams,
he admitted many of the compositions of Meleager, Philip, and
other predecessors. These collections belong to the classical period
of Greek literature. But the Anthology, as we possess it,
had not yet come into existence. It remained for Agathias, a
Byzantine Greek of the age of Justinian, to undertake a comprehensive
compilation from all the previous collections. After adding
numerous poems of a date posterior to Straton, especially
those of Paulus Silentiarius, Macedonius, Rufinus, and himself,
he edited his &#954;&#8059;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;, divided into seven books.
The first book contained dedicatory epigrams, the second descriptive
poems, the third epitaphs, the fourth reflections on the
various events of life, the fifth satires, the sixth erotic verses, the
seventh exhortations to enjoyment. Upon the general outline of
the Anthology as arranged by Agathias two subsequent collections
were founded. Constantinus Cephalas, in the tenth century, at
Byzantium, and in the reign of Constantinus Porphyrogenitus,
undertook a complete revision and recombination of all pre-existing
anthologies. With the patience of a literary bookworm, to
whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> the splendid libraries of the metropolis were accessible, he
set about his work, and gave to the Greek anthology that form
which it now bears. But the vicissitudes of the Anthology did
not terminate with the labors of Cephalas. Early in the fourteenth
century a monk, Planudes, set to work upon a new edition.
It appears that he contented himself with compiling and
abridging from the collection of Cephalas. His principal object
was to expurgate it from impurities and to supersede it by what
he considered a more edifying text. Accordingly he emended,
castrated, omitted, interpolated, altered, and remodelled at his own
sweet will: "non magis disposuit quam mutilavit et ut ita dicam
castravit hunc librum, detractis lascivioribus epigrammatis, ut ipse
gloriatur," says Lascaris in the preface to his edition of the Planudean
Anthology.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> He succeeded, however, to the height of his
desire; for copies ceased to be made of the Anthology of Cephalas;
and when Europe in the fifteenth century awoke to the
study of Greek literature, no other collection but that of Planudes
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>known. Fortunately for this most precious relic of antiquity,
there did exist one exemplar of the Anthology of Cephalas.
Having escaped the search of Poggio, Aurispa, Filelfo,
Poliziano, and of all the emissaries whom the Medici employed
in ransacking the treasure-houses of Europe, this unique manuscript
was at last discovered in 1606 by Claude de Saumaise,
better known as Milton's antagonist Salmasius, in the Palatine
Library at Heidelberg. A glance at this treasure assured the
young scholar&mdash;for Saumaise was then aged only twenty-two&mdash;that
he had made one of the most important discoveries which
remained within the reach of modern students. He spent years
in preparing a critical edition of its text; but all his work was
thrown away, for the Leyden publishers to whom he applied
refused to publish the Greek without a Latin version, and death
overtook him before he had completed the requisite labor. Meanwhile
the famous Palatine MS. had been transferred, after the sack
of Heidelberg in 1623, to the Vatican, as a present to Pope Gregory
XV. Isaac Voss, the rival of Saumaise, induced one Lucas
Langermann to undertake a journey to Rome, in order that he
might make a faithful transcript of the MS. and publish it, to the
annoyance of the great French scholar. But Saumaise dying in
1653, the work, undertaken from motives of jealousy, was suspended.
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>MS. reposed still upon the shelves of the Vatican
Library; and in 1776 the Abb&eacute; Giuseppe Spalletti completed a
trustworthy copy of its pages, which was bought by Ernest, Duke
of Gotha and Altenburg, for his library. In the year 1797 the
MS. itself was transferred to Paris after the treaty of Tolentino;
and in 1815 it was restored to Heidelberg, where it now reposes.
Meanwhile Brunck had published, from copies of this MS., the
greater portion of the Anthology in his <i>Analecta Veterum Poetarum
Gr&aelig;corum</i>; and Jacobs, between 1794 and 1814, had edited
the whole collection with minutest accuracy upon the faith of
the Abb&eacute; Spalletti's exemplar. The edition of Didot, to which I
shall refer in my examination of the Anthology,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> is based not only
on the labors of Brunck and Jacobs, but also upon the MSS. of the
unfortunate Chardon de la Rochette, who, after spending many
years of his life in the illustration of the Anthology of Cephalas,
was forced in old age to sell his collections for a small su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>m. They
passed in 1836 into the possession of the (then) Imperial Library.</p>

<p>The Palatine MS., which is our sole authority for the Anthology
as arranged by Cephalas, is a 4to parchment of 710 pages. It
has been written by different hands, at different times, and on different
plans of arrangement. The index does not always agree
with the contents, but seems to be that of an older collection, of
which the one we possess is an imperfect copy. Yet Cephalas is
often mentioned, and always with affectionate reverence, by the
transcribers of the MS. In one place he is called &#8001; &#956;&#945;&#954;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7936;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8057;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, "the blessed man, who is ever
to be held in thrice affectionate and longing recollection," the sentiment
of which words we in the middle of this nineteenth century
may most cordially echo.</p>

<p>The first section of the Anthology is devoted to Christian epigrams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>upon the chief religious monuments and statues of Byzantium.
However these may interest the ecclesiastical student, they
have no value for a critic of Greek poetry. The second section
consists of a poem in hexameters upon the statues which adorned
the gymnasium of Zeuxippus. Some conception may be formed,
after the perusal of this very pedestrian composition, of the art
treasures which Byzantium contained in the fifth century. Authentic
portraits of the great poets and philosophers of Greece, as
well as works of imagination illustrative of the <i>Iliad</i> and the Attic
tragedies, might then be studied in one place of public resort.
Byzantium had become a vast museum for the ancient world.
The third section is devoted to mural inscriptions from the temple
of Apollonis in Cyzicus. The fourth contains the prefaces of
Meleager, Philip, and Agathias, to their several collections. The
fifth, which includes 309 epigrams, is consecrated to erotic poetry.
The sixth, which numbers 358, consists of a collection of inscriptions
from temples and public monuments recording the illustrious
actions of the Greeks or votive offerings of private persons. In
the seventh we read 748 epitaphs of various sorts. The eighth
carries us again into the dismal region of post-pagan literature: it
contains nothing but 254 poems from the pen of Saint Gregory
the Theologian. The 827 epigrams of the ninth section are
called by their collector &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8049;; that is to say, they are composed
in illustration of a variety of subjects, anecdotical, rhetorical,
and of general interest. Perhaps this part of the whole Anthology
has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>been the favorite of modern imitators and translators.
Passing to the tenth section, we find 126 semi-philosophical poems,
most of which record the vanity of human life and advise mortals
to make the best of their brief existence by enjoyment. The
eleventh is devoted to satire. It is here that the reflex influence
of Latin on Greek literature is most perceptible. The twelfth
section bears the name of Straton, and exhibits in its 258 epigrams
the morality of ancient Hellas under the aspect which has
least attraction for modern readers. The thirteenth embraces a
few epigrams in irregular metres. The fourteenth is made up of
riddles and oracles. The fifteenth, again, has half a century of
poems which could not well be catalogued elsewhere. The sixteenth
contains that part of the Planudean collection which does
not occur in our copy of the Anthology of Cephalas. It may be
mentioned in conclusion that, with one or two very inconsidera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>ble
exceptions, none of the poems of the early Greek lyrists and
Gnomic writers are received into the so-called Anthology.</p>

<p>To the student of Greek history and Greek customs no section
of the Anthology is more interesting than that which includes the
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8049;, the record of the public and the private
votive offerings in Hellas. Here, as in a scroll spread out before
us, in the silver language of the great Simonides,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> may be read
the history of the achievements of the Greeks against Xerxes and
his hosts. The heroes of Marathon, the heroes of Thermopyl&aelig;,
Megistias the soothsayer, Leonidas the king, Pausanias the general,
the seamen of Salamis, the Athenian cavalry, the Spartans of
Plat&aelig;a&mdash;all receive their special tribute of august celebration at
the hands of the poet who best knew how to suit simple words
to splendid actions. Again, the &#963;&#964;&#8053;&#955;&#951; which commemorated in
Athens the patriotic tyrannicide of Aristogeiton, the statue of Pan
which Miltiades after Marathon consecrated in honor of his victory,
the trophies erected by Pausanias at Delphi to Ph&#339;bus, the
altar to Zeus Eleutherios dedicated in common by all the Greeks,
the tripod sent to Delphi by Gelon and the other tyrants of Sicily
after their victory over the Carthaginians, for each and all of these
Simonides was called on to compose imperishable verse. Our
hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>t trembles even now when we read such lines as these:</p>

<p>But it is not merely within the sphere of world-famous history
that the dedicatory epigrams are interesting. Multitudes of them
introduce us to the minutest facts of private life in Greece. We
see the statues of gods hung round with flowers and scrolls, the
shrines filled with waxen tablets, wayside chapels erected to Priapus
or to Pan, the gods of the shore honored with dripping clothes
of mariners, the Paphian home of Aphrodite rich with jewels and
with mirrors and with silks suspended by devout adorers of both
sexes. A fashionable church in modern Italy&mdash;the Annunziata
at F<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>lorence, for example, or St. Anthony at Padua&mdash;is not more
crowded with pictures of people saved from accidents, with silver
hearts and waxen limbs, with ribbons and artificial flowers, with
rosaries and precious stones, and with innumerable objects that
only tell their tale of bygone vows to the votary who hung them
there, than were the temples of our Lady of Love in Cneidos or
in Corinth. In the epigrams before us we read how hunters hung
their nets to Pan, and fishermen their gear to Poseidon; gardeners
their figs and pomegranates to Priapus; blacksmiths their
hammers and tongs to Heph&aelig;stus. Stags are dedicated to Artemis
and Ph&#339;bus, and corn-sheaves to Demeter, who also receives
the plough, the sickle, and the oxen of farmers. A poor man
offers the produce of his field to Pan; the first-fruits of the vine
are set aside for Bacchus and his crew of satyrs; Pallas obtains
the shuttle of a widow who resolves to quit her life of care and
turn to Aphrodite; the eunuch Alexis offers his cymbals, drums,
flutes, knife, and golden curls to Cybele. Ph&#339;bus is presented
with a golden cicada, Zeus with an old ash spear that has seen
service, Ares with a shield and cuirass. A poet dedicates roses to
the maids of Helicon and laurel-wreaths to Apollo. Scribes offer
their pens and ink and pumice-stone to Hermes; cooks hang up
their pots and pans and spits to the Mercury of the kitchen.
Withered crowns and revel-cups are laid upon the shrine of Lais;
Anchises suspends his white hair to Aphrodite, Endymion his bed
and coverlet to Artemis, Daphnis his club to Pan. Agathias inscribes
his <i>Daphniaca</i> to the Paphian queen. Prexidike has an
embr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>oidered dress to dedicate. Alkibie offers her hair to Here,
Lais her mirror to Aphrodite, Krobylus his boy's curls to Apollo,
Charixeinos his long tresses to the nymphs. Meleager yields the
lamp of his love-hours to Venus; Lucillius vows his hair after
shipwreck to the sea-gods; Evanthe gives her thyrsus and stag's
hide to Bacchus. Women erect altars to Eleithuia and Asclepius
after childbirth. Sophocles dedicates a thanksgiving shrine for
poetic victories. Simonides and Bacchylides record their triumphs
upon votive tablets. Gallus, saved from a lion, consecrates his
hair and vestments to the queen of Dindymus. Prostitutes abandon
their ornaments to Kupris on their marriage. The effeminate
Statullion bequeaths his false curls and flutes and silken wardrobe
to Priapus. Sailors offer a huge cuttlefish to the sea-deities. An
Isthmian victor suspends his bit, bridle, spurs, and whip to Poseidon.
A boy emerging into manhood leaves his petasos and strigil
and chlamys to Hermes, the god of games. Phryne dedicates
winged Eros as the first-fruits of her earnings. Hadrian celebrates
the trophies erected by Trajan to Zeus. Theocritus writes
inscriptions for Uranian Aphrodite in the house of his friend Amphicles,
for the Bacchic tripod of Damomenes, and for the marble
muse of Xenocles. Erinna dedicates the picture of Agatharkis.
Meli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>nna, Sab&aelig;this, and Mikythus are distinguished by poems placed
beneath their portraits. There is even a poem on the picture of
a hernia dedicated apparently in some Asclepian shrine; and a
traveller erects the brazen image of a frog in thanksgiving for a
draught of wayside water. Cleonymus consecrates the statues of
the nymphs:</p>

<p>It will be seen by this rapid enumeration that a good many of the
dedicatory epigrams are really epideictic or rhetorical; that is to
say, they are written on imaginary subjects. But the large majority
undoubtedly record such votive offerings as were common
enough in Greece with or without epigrams to grace them.</p>

<p>What I have just said about the distinction between real and
literary epigrams composed for dedications applies still more to
the epitaphs. These divide themselves into two well-marked
classes: 1. Actual sepulchral inscrip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>tions or poems written immediately
upon the death of persons contemporary with the author;
and, 2. Literary exercises in the composition of verses appropriate
to the tombs of celebrated historical or mythical characters.
To the first class belong the beautiful epitaphs of Meleager
upon Clearista (i. 307), upon Heliodora (i. 365), upon Charixeinos,
a boy twelve years old (i. 363), upon Antipater of Sidon (i. 355),
and the three which he designed for his own grave (i. 352). Callimachus
has left some perfect models in this species of composition.
The epitaph on Heracleitus, a poet of Halicarnassus, which
has been exquisitely translated by the author of <i>Ionica</i>, has a grace
of movement and a tenderness of pathos that are unsurpassed:</p>

<p>In each of these epitaphs the untimely fading of a flower-like
maiden in her prime has roused the deepest feeling of the poetess.
This, indeed, is the chord which rings most truly in the sepulchral
lyre of the Greeks. Their most genuine sorrow is for youth cut
off before the joys of life were tasted. This sentiment receives,
perhaps, its most pathetic though least artistic expression in the
following anonymous epitaph on a young man. The mother's
love and anguish are set forth with a vividness which we should
scarcely have expected from a Greek (i. 336):</p>

<p>The common topic of consolation in these cases of untimely death
is the one which Shakespeare has expressed in the dirge for Fidele,
and D'Urfey in his dirge for Chrysostom by these four lines:</p>

<p>It is pleasant to turn from these to epitaphs which dwell more
upon the qualities of the dead than the circumstances of their
death. Here is the epitaph of a slave (i. 379):</p>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful of all the sepulchral epigrams is one
by an unknown writer, of which I here give a free paraphrase
(<i>Anth. Pal.</i> vii. 346):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of our great love, Parthenophil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This little stone abideth still<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Sole sign and token:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seek thee yet, and yet shall seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though faint mine eyes, my spirit weak<br /></span>
<span class="i10">With prayers unspoken.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, best friend of friends, do thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this the cruel fates allow<br /></span>
<span class="i10">By death's dark river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those shadowy people, drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No drop for me on Lethe's brink:<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Forget me never!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of all the literary epitaphs, by far the most interesting are those
written for the poets, historians, and philosophers of Greece. Reserving
these for separate consideration, I pass now to mention a
few which belong as much to the pure epigram as to the epitaph.
When, for example, we read two very clever poems on the daughters
of Lycambes (i. 339), two again on a comically drunken old
woman (i. 340, 360), and five on a man who has been first murdered
and then buried by his murderer (i. 340), we see that, though
the form of the epitaph has been adopted, clever rhetoricians,
anxious only to display their skill, have been at work in rivalry.
Sardanapalus, the eponym of Oriental luxury, furnishes a good
subject for this style of composition. His epitaph runs thus in
the Appendix Planudea (ii. 532):</p>

<p>We find only the fourth and fifth lines among the sepulchral epigrams
of the Anthology of Cephalas (i. 334), followed by a clever
parody composed by the Theban Crates. Demetrius, the Spartan
coward, is another instance of this rhetorical exercise. Among the
two or three which treat of him I quote the following (i. 317):</p>

<p>An epitaph on the inutility of epitaphs is an excellent novelty,

<p>The value of the epitaphs on poets and great men of Greece is
this&mdash;that, besides being in many cases of almost perfect beauty,
they contain the quintessence of ancient criticism. Every epithet
is carefully so chosen as to express what the Greeks thought peculiar
and appropriate to the spirit and the works of their heroes.</p>

more tributes of this kind than any other poet, roses are to

<p>The epitaphs on Erinna, who died when she was only nineteen,
are charged with the thought which so often recurs when we reflect
on poets, like Chatterton, untimely slain&mdash;what would not
they have done, if they had lived? (i. 275):</p>

<p>This is the composition of Antipater of Sidon, who excels in
this special style. Without losing either the movement or the
passion of poetry, he is always delicate and subtle in his judgments.
His epigrams on Pindar are full of fire (i. 280):</p>

another epitaph on Pindar by Antipater, which for its beautiful
presentation of two legends connected with his life deserves to be
quoted:</p>

<p>Enough has been quoted to show the delicate and appreciative
criticism of the later and lighter Greek poets for the earlier and
grander. It is also consolatory to find that almost no unknown
great ones are praised in these epigrams; whence we may conclude
that the masterpieces of Greek literature are almost as numerous
now as they were in the age of Nero. The philosophers
receive their due meed of celebration. Plato can boast of two
splendid anonymous epitaphs (i. 285):</p>

<p>It is curious to find both Thucydides (ii. 119) and Lycophron
(ii. 38) characterized by their difficulty.</p>

<p>Closely allied in point of subject to many of the epitaphs are
the so-called hortatory epigrams, &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8049;. These
consist partly of advice to young men and girls to take while they
may the pleasures of the moment, partly of wise saws and maxims
borrowed from the Stoics and the Cynics, from Euripides and the
comic poets. Lucian and Palladas are the two most successful
poets in this style. Palladas, whose life falls in the first half of
the fifth century, a pagan, who regarded with disgust the establishment
of Christianity, attained by a style of "elegant mediocrity"
to the perfection of proverbial philosophy in verse. When
we remember that the works of Euripides, Menander, Philemon,
Theophrastus, and the Stoics were mines from which to quarry
sentiments about the conduct of life, we understand the general
average of excellence below which he rarely falls and above which
he never rises. Yet in this section, as in the others of the Anthology,
some of the anonymous epigrams are the best. Here is
one (ii. 251):</p>

<p>When he chooses to be cynical, Palladas can present the physical
conditions of human life with a crude brutality which is worthy
of a monk composing a chapter <i>De contemptu human&aelig; miseri&aelig;</i>.
It is enough to allude to the epigrams upon the birth (ii. 259)
and the breath (ii. 265) of man. To this had philosophy fallen
in the death of Greece. One more quotation from Palladas has
a touch of pathos. The old order has yielded to the new: Theodosius
has closed the temples: the Greeks are in ashes: their
very hopes remain among the dead (ii. 268):</p>

<p>With this wail the thin, lamentable voice of the desiccated rhetorician
ceases.</p>

<p>Akin to these hortatory epigrams, in their tone of settled melancholy,
are some of the satiric and convivial. It is necessary,
when we think of the Greeks as the brightest and sunniest of all
races, to remember what songs they sang at their banquets, and
to comfort ourselves with the reflection that between their rose-wreaths
and the bright Hellenic sky above them hung for them,
no less than for ourselves, the cloud of death.</p>

<p>What more dismal drinking-song can be conceived than this?

<p>The good sense of Cephalas placed it among the epitaphs; for, in
truth, it is the quintessence of the despair of the grave. Yet its
last couplet forces us to drag it from the place of tombs, and put
it into the mouth of some late reveller of the decadence of Hellas.
It has to my ear the ring of a drinking-song sung in a room with
closed shutters, after the guests have departed, by some sad companion
who does not know that the dawn has gone forth and
the birds are aloft in the air. The shadow of night is upon him.
Though Christ be risen and the sun of hope is in the sky, he is
still as cheerless as Mimnermus. If space sufficed, it would be
both interesting and profitable to compare this mood of the epigrammatists
with that expressed by Omar Khayy&aacute;m, the Persian
poet of Khorassan, in whose quatrains philosophy, melancholy,
and the sense of beauty are so wonderfully mingled that to surpass
their pathos is impossible in verse.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Here is another of the

<p>But the majority of the &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#954;&#969;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8049;, or jesting epigrams,
are not of this kind. They are written for the most part, in Roman
style, on ugly old women, misers, stupid actors, doctors to
dream of whom is death, bad painters, poets who kill you with
their elegies, men so light that the wind carries them about like
stubble, or so thin that a gossamer is strong enough to strangle
them; vices, meannesses, deformities of all kinds. Lucillius, a
Greek Martial of the age of Nero, is both best and most prolific
in this kind of composition. But of all the sections of the Anthology
this is certainly the least valuable. The true superiority
of Greek to Latin literature in all its species is that it is far more
a work of pure beauty, of unmixed poetry. In Lucillius the Hellenic
muse has deigned for once to assume the Roman toga, and
to show that if she chose she could rival the hoarse-throated satirists
of the empire on their own ground. But she has abandoned
her lofty eminence, and descended to a lower level. The same
may be said in brief about the versified problems and riddles (ii.
pp. 467-490), which are not much better than elegant acrostics
of this or the last century. It must, however, be remarked that
the last-mentioned section contains a valuable collection of Greek
oracles.</p>

<p>Of all the amatory poets of the Anthology, by far the noblest
is Meleager. He was a native of Gadara in Palestine, as he tells
us in an epitaph composed in his old age:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#961;&#945; &#948;&#8051; &#956;&#949; &#964;&#949;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#8150;<br /></span>

<p>It is curious to think of this town, which from our childhood
we have connected with the miracle of the demoniac and the
swine, as a Syrian Athens, the birthplace of the most mellifluous
of all erotic songsters. Meleager's date is half a century or thereabouts
before the Christian era. He therefore was ignorant of
the work and the words of One who made the insignificant place
of his origin world-famous. Of his history we know really nothing
more than his own epigrams convey; the two following couplets
from one of his epitaphs record his sojourn during different
periods of his life at Tyre and at Ceos:</p>

<p>This triple salutation, coming from the son of Gadara and Tyre
and Ceos, brings us close to the pure humanity which distinguished
Meleager. Modern men, judging him by the standard of
Christian morality, may feel justified in flinging a stone at the
poet who celebrated his Muiscos and his Diocles, his Heliodora
and his Zenophila, in too voluptuous verse. But those who are
content to criticise a pagan by his own rule of right and wrong
will admit that Meleager had a spirit of the subtlest and the
sweetest, a heart of the tenderest, and a genius of the purest that
has been ever granted to an elegist of earthly love. While reading
his verse, it is impossible to avoid laying down the book and
pausing to exclaim: How modern is the phrase, how true the passion,
how unique the style! Though Meleager's voice has been
mute a score of centuries, it yet rings clear and vivid in our ears;
because the man was a real poet, feeling intensely, expressing forcibly
and beautifully, steeping his style in the fountain of tender
sentiment which is eternal. We find in him none of the cynicism
which defiles Straton, or of the voluptuary's despair which gives to
Agathias the morbid splendor of decay, the colors of corruption.
All is simple, lively, fresh with joyous experience in his verse.</p>

<p>The first great merit of Meleager as a poet is limpidity. A
crystal is not more transparent than his style; but the crystal to
which we compare it must be colored with the softest flush of
beryl or of amethyst. Here is a little poem in praise of Heliodora
(i. 85):</p>

<p>These quotations are sufficient to set forth the purity of Meleager's
style, though many more examples might have been borrowed
from his epigrams on the cicada, on the mosquitoes who tormented
Zenophila, on Antiochus, who would have been Eros if
Eros had worn the boy's petasos and chlamys. The next point
to notice about him is the suggestiveness of his language, his faculty
of creating the right epithets and turning the perfect phrase
that suits his meaning. The fragrance of the second line in this
couplet is undefinable but potent:</p>

<p>It is what all day-dreamers and castle-builders, not to speak of

elevated to a region of novel beauty by the passionate repetition

sleep-cheating), to express the qualities of the treacherous god.
In some of his metaphorical descriptions of passion he displays a
really fervid imagination. To this class of creation belong the
poem on the Soul's thirst (ii. 414), on the memory of beauty that
lives like a fiery image in the heart (ii. 413), and the following
splendid picture of the tyranny of Love. He is addressing his
Soul, who has once again incautiously been trapped by Eros:</p>

<p>Surely a more successful marriage of romantic fancy to classic

<p>Meleager had a soul that inclined to all beautiful and tender

the lyre)&mdash;a conceit, by the way, in the style of Marini or of Calderon&mdash;the
bee whom he addresses as &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#948;&#8055;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#949; &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#945; (flower-pasturing
bee), and all the flowers for which he has found exquisite
epithets, the &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#946;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#8049;&#961;&#954;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#962; (narcissus that loves the rain
of heaven), the &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#8165;&#8057;&#948;&#945; (roses to lovers dear), the &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#8055;&#966;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#945;
&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#945; (lilies that roam the mountain-sides), and again &#964;&#8048;
&#947;&#949;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#954;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#945; (laughing lilies), testify to the passionate love and
to the purity of heart with which he greeted and studied the simplest
beauties of the world.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In dealing with flowers he is particularly
felicitous. Most exquisite are the lines in which he describes
his garland of the Greek poets and assigns to each some
favorite of the garden or the field, and again those other couplets
which compare the boys of Tyre to a bouquet culled by love for
Aphrodite. &#914;&#945;&#953;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#8165;&#8057;&#948;&#945; (slight things perhaps, but roses):
these are the words in which Meleager describes the too few but
precious verses of Sappho, and for his own poetry they have a
peculiar propriety. &#932;&#949;&#945;&#8054; &#950;&#8061;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#8053;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;, (thy nightingales still
live) we may say, quoting Callimachus, when we take leave of
him. His poetry has the sweetness and the splendor of the rose,
the rapture and full-throated melody of the nightingale.</p>

<p>Next in artistic excellence to Meleager among the amatory
poets is Straton, a Greek of Sardis, who lived in the second century.
But there are few readers who, even for the sake of his
pure and perfect language, will be prepared to put up with the
immodesty of his subject-matter. Straton is not so delicate and
subtle in style as Meleager; but he has a masculine vigor and
<i>nettet&eacute;</i> of phrase peculiar to himself. It is not possible to quote
many of his epigrams. He suffers the neglect which necessarily
obscures those men of genius who misuse their powers. Yet the
story of the garland-weaver (ii. 396), and the address to schoolmasters
(ii. 219), are too clever to be passed by without notice.
The following epigram on a picture of Ganymede gives a very
fair notion of Straton's style (ii. 425):</p>

<p>Callimachus deserves mention as a third with Meleager and
Straton. His style, drier than that of Meleager, more elevated
than Straton's, is marked by a frigidity of good scholarship which
only at intervals warms into the fire of passionate poetry. In
writing epigrams Callimachus was careful to preserve the pointed
character of the composition. He did not merely, as is the frequent
wont of Meleager, indite a short poem in elegiacs. This
being the case, his love poems, though they are many, are not
equal to his epitaphs.</p>

<p>To mention all the poets of the amatory chapters would be impossible.
Their name is legion. Even Plato the divine, by right

<p>takes rank in the erotic cycle. Yet we may touch in passing on
the names of Philodemus and Antipater, the former a native of
Gadara, the latter a Sidonian, whose epitaph was composed by
Meleager. Their poems help to complete the picture of Syrian
luxury and culture in the cities of North Palestine, which we gain
when reading Meleager. Of Philodemus the liveliest epigram is
a dialogue, which seems to have come straight from the pages of
some comedy (i. 68); but the majority of his verses belong to
that class of literature which finds its illustration in the Gabinetto
Segreto of the Neapolitan Museum. Occasionally he strikes a true
note of poetry, as in this invocation to the moon:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Antipater shines less in his erotic poems than in the numerous epigrams
which he composed on the earlier Greek poets, especially on
Anacreon, Erinna, Sappho, Pindar, Ibycus. He lived at a period when
the study of the lyrists was still flouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>shing, and each of his couplets
contains a fine and thoughtful piece of descriptive criticism.</p>

<p>Another group of amatory poets must be mentioned. Agathias,
Macedonius, and Paulus Silentiarius, Greeks of Byzantium
about the age of Justinian, together with Rufinus, whose date is
not quite certain, yield the very last fruits of the Greek genius,
after it had been corrupted by the lusts of Rome and the effeminacy
of the East. Very pale and hectic are the hues which give
a sort of sickly beauty to their style. Their epigrams vary between
querulous lamentations over old age and death and highly
colored pictures of self-satisfied sensuality. Rufinus is a kind of
second Straton in the firmness of his touch, the cynicism of his
impudicity. The complaint of Agathias to the swallows that
twittered at his window in early dawn (i. 102), his description of
Rhodanthe and the vintage feast (ii. 297),<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and those lines in
which he has anticipated Jonson's lyric on the kiss which made
the wine within the cup inebriating (i. 107), may be quoted as
fair specimens of his style. Of Paulus Silentiarius I do not care
to allude to more than the poem in which he describes the joy of
two lovers (i. 106). What Ariosto and Boiardo have dwelt on in
some of their most brilliant episodes, what Giorgione has painted
in the eyes of the shepherd who envies the kiss given by Rachel
to Jacob, is here compressed into eighteen lines of great literary
beauty. But a man need be neither a prude nor a Puritan to
turn with sadness and with loathing from these last autumnal
blossoms on the tree of Greek beauty. The brothel and the grave
are all that is left for Rufinus and his contemporaries. Over the
one hangs the black shadow of death; the other is tenanted by
ghosts of carnal joy:</p>

<span class="i0">Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lingering, and sitting by a new-made grave,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Before taking leave of the erotic poets of the Anthology, I shall
here insert a few translations made by me from Meleager, Straton,
and some anonymous poets. The first epigram illustrates the
Greek custom of going at night, after drinking, with lighted
torches to the house of the beloved person, and there suspending
garlands on the door. It is not easy to find an equivalent for
the characteristic Greek word &#954;&#969;&#956;&#8049;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;. I have tried to deal with
it by preserving the original allusion to the revel:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The die is cast! Nay, light the torch!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll take the road! Up, courage, ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why linger pondering in the porch?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon Love's revel we will go!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shake off those fumes of wine! Hang care<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And caution! What has Love to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prudence? Let the torches flare!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quick, drown the doubts that hampered you!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cast weary wisdom to the wind!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One thing, but one alone, I know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love bent e'en Jove and made him blind!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon Love's revel we will go!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second, by Meleager, turns upon the same custom; but it is
here treated with the originality of imagination distinctive of his
style:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've drunk sheer madness! Not with wine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But old fantastic tales I'll arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart in heedlessness divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dare the road nor dream of harm!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'll join Love's rout! Let thunder break,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let lightning blast me by the way!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Invulnerable Love shall shake<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His &aelig;gis o'er my head to-day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a third, Meleager recommends hard drinking as a remedy for
the pains of love:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Drink, luckless lover! Thy heart's fiery rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bacchus who gives oblivion shall assuage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink deep, and while thou drain'st the brimming bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive love's dark anguish from thy fevered soul.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Two of these little compositions deal with the old comparison
between love and the sea. In the first, the lover's journey is likened
to a comfortless voyage, where the house of the beloved will
be for him safe anchorage after the storm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cold blows the winter wind: 'tis Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose sweet eyes swim with honeyed tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bears me to thy doors, my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tossed by the storm of hopes and fears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cold blows the blast of aching Love;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But be thou for my wandering sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adrift upon these waves of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Safe harbor from the whistling gale!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<p>In the second, love itself is likened to the ocean, always shifting,
never to be trusted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My love is like an April storm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a false and fickle sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day you shine, and sunny warm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are those clear smiles you shower on me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next day from cloudy brows you rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your anger on the ruffled main.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Around me all the deeps are dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I whirl and wander to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one who vainly steers his bark<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mid winds that battle as they blow:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then raise the flag of love or hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I at last may know my fate!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The peculiar distinction of Meleager's genius gives its special
quality to the following dedication, in which the poet either is,
or feigns himself to be, made captive by Love upon first landing
in a strange country:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Lady of desires, a goddess, gave<br /></span>
<span class="i10">My soul to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee soft-sandalled Love hath sent, a slave,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
<span class="i10">Poor naked me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger on a stranger's soil, tight-bound<br /></span>
<span class="i10">With bands of steel:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do but pray that we may once be found<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Firm friends and leal!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet thou dost spurn my prayers, refuse my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Still stern and mute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time will not melt thee, nor the deeds that prove<br /></span>
<span class="i10">How pure my suit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have pity, king, have pity! Fate hath willed<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Thee god and lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life in thy hands and death, to break or build,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">For me is stored!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next specimen is an attempt to render into English stanzas
one of Meleager's most passionate poems:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did I not tell you so, and cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Rash soul, by Venus, you'll be caught!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, luckless soul, why will you fly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So near the toils that Love had wrought?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did I not warn you? Now the net<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has tangled you, and in the string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You vainly strive, for Love hath set<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bound your pinions, wing to wing;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And placed you on the flames to pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And rubbed with myrrh your panting lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you thirsted given you wine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of hot and bitter tears to sip.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, weary soul, fordone with pain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now in the fire you burn, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take respite for a while again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Draw better breath and cool your brow!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why weep and wail? What time you first<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sheltered wild Love within your breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did you not know the boy you nursed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would prove a false and cruel guest?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did you not know? See, now he pays<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The guerdon of your fostering care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fire that on the spirit preys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mixed with cold snow-flakes of despair!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You chose your lot. Then cease to weep:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Endure this torment: tame your will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember, what you sowed, you reap:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, though it burns, 'tis honey still!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, lastly, is an Envoy, slightly altered in the English translation
from Straton's original:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It may be in the years to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men who love shall think of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reading o'er these verses see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How love was my life's martyrdom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love-songs I write for him and her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now this, now that, as Love dictates;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One birthday gift alone the Fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave me, to be Love's scrivener.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One large section of the Anthology remains to be considered.
It contains what are called the &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8049;, or poems
upon various subjects chosen for their propriety for rhetorical
exposition. These epigrams, the favorites of modern imitators,
display the Greek taste in this style of composition to the best
advantage. The Greeks did not regard the epigram merely as a
short poem with a sting in its tail&mdash;to quote the famous couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Omne epigramma sit instar apis: sit aculeus illi:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sint sua mella: sit et corporis exigui.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>True to the derivation of the word, which means an ins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>cription
or superscription, they were satisfied if an epigram were short
and gifted with the honey-dews of Helicon.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Meleager would
have called his collection a beehive, and not a flower-garland, if
he had acknowledged the justice of the Latin definition which
has just been cited. The epigrams of which I am about to speak
are simply little occasional poems, fugitive pieces, <i>Gelegenheitsgedichte</i>,
varying in length from two to twenty lines, composed
in elegiac metre, and determined, as to form and treatment, by
the exigencies of the subject. Some of them, it is true, are noticeable
for their point; but point is not the same as sting. The
following panegyric of Athens, for example, approximates to the
epigram as it is commonly conceived (ii. 13):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#947;&#8135; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7956;&#945;&#961; &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#948;&#8051;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#959;&#962;, &#945;&#7984;&#952;&#8051;&#961;&#953; &#948;' &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#7961;&#955;&#955;&#8049;&#948;&#953; &#948;' &#7973;&#948;&#949; &#967;&#952;&#8061;&#957;, &#959;&#7989;&#948;&#949; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#8057;&#955;&#949;&#970;.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same may be said about the lines upon the vine and the goat
(ii. 15; compare 20):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>and the following satire, so well known by the parody of Porson
(ii. 325):</p>

<p>Again the play of words in the last line of this next epigram

<p>The Greek epigram has this, in fact, in common with all good
poems, that the conclusion should be the strongest and most emphatic
portion. But in liberty of subject and of treatment it corresponds
to the Italian sonnet. Unquestionably of this kind is
the famous poem of Ptolemy upon the stars (ii. 118), which recalls
to mind the saying of Kant, that the two things which
moved his awe were the stars of heaven above him and the moral
law within the soul of man:</p>

<p>Some of the epigrams of this section are written in the true
style of elegies. The following splendid threnody by Antipater
of Sidon upon the ruins of Corinth, which was imitated by Agathias
in his lines on Troy, may be cited as perfect in this style of
composition (ii. 29):</p>

<p>It is a grand picture of the queen of pleasure in her widowhood
and desolation mourned over by the deathless daughters of
the plunging sea. Occasionally the theme of the epigram is historical.
The finest, perhaps, of this sort is a poem by Philippus
on Leonidas (ii. 59):</p>

<p>Few, however, of the epigrams rise to the altitude of those I
have been lately quoting. Their subjects are for the most part
simple incidents, or such as would admit of treatment within the
space of an engraved gem. The story of the girls who played at
dice upon the house-roof is told very prettily in the following
lines (ii. 31):</p>

<p>Among the epigrams which seem to have been composed in
the same spirit as those exquisite little <i>capricci</i> engraved by Greek
artists upon gems, few are more felicitous than the three following.
The affection of the Greeks for the grasshopper is one of
their most charming <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;s</i>. Everybody knows the pretty story
Socrates tells about these &#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8134;&#964;&#945;&#953;, or Prophets of the
Muses, in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>&mdash;how they once were mortals who took
such delight in the songs of the Muses that, "Singing always,
they never thought of eating and drinking, until at last they forgot
and died: and now they live again in the grasshoppers, and
this is the return the Muses make to them&mdash;they hunger no more,
neither thirst any more, but are always singing from the moment
that they are born, and never eating or drinking." Thus the
grasshoppers were held sacred in Greece, like storks in Germany
and robins in England. Most of the epigrams about them turn
on this sanctity. The following is a plea for pity from an imprisoned
grasshopper to the rustics who have caught him (ii. 76):</p>

<p>Another epigram on the same page tells how the poet found a
grasshopper struggling in a spider's web and released it with
these words: "Go safe and free with your sweet voice of song!"
But the prettiest of all is this long story (ii. 119):</p>

<p>So friendly were the relations of the Greeks with the grasshoppers.
We do not wonder when we read that the Athenians wore
golden grasshoppers in their hair.</p>

<p>Baths, groves, gardens, houses, temples, city-gates, and works of
art furnish the later epigrammatists with congenial subjects. The
Greeks of the Empire exercised much ingenuity in describing&mdash;whether
in prose, like Philostratus, or in verse, like Agathias&mdash;the
famous monuments of the maturity of Hellas. In this style
the epigrams on statues are at once the most noticeable and the
most abundant. The cow of Myron has at least two score of
little sonnets to herself. The horses of Lysippus, the Zeus of
Pheidias, the Rhamnusian statue of Nemesis, the Praxitelean Venus,
various images of Eros, the Niobids, Marsyas, Ariadne, Herakles,
Alexander, poets, physicians, orators, historians, and all the
charioteers and athletes preserved in the museums of Byzantium
or the groves of Altis, are described with a minu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>teness and a
point that enable us to identify many of them with the surviving
monuments of Greek sculpture. Pictures also come in for their
due share of notice. A Polyxena of Polycletus, a Philoctetes of
Parrhasius, and a Medea, which may have been the original of the
famous Pompeian fresco, are specially remarkable. Then again
cups engraved with figures in relief of Tantalus or Love, seals
inscribed with Ph&#339;bus or Medusa, gems and intaglios of all
kinds, furnish matter for other epigrams. The following couplet
on the amethyst turns upon an untranslatable play of words (ii.
149):</p>

<p>Amid this multitude of poems it is difficult to make a fair or representative
selection. There are, however, four which I cannot
well omit. The first is written by Poseidippus on a lost statue of
Lysippus (ii. 584):</p>

<p>In bringing this review of the Anthology to a close, I feel that
I have been guilty of two errors. I have wearied the reader with
quotations; yet I have omitted countless epigrams of the purest
beauty. The very riches of this flower-garden of little poems are
an obstacle to its due appreciation. Each epigram in itself is perfect,
and ought to be carefully and lovingly studied. But it is
difficult for the critic to deal in a single essay with upwards of
four thousand of these precious gems. There are many points of
view which with adequate space and opportunity might have been
taken for the better illustration of the epigrams. Their connection
with the later literature of Greece, especially with the rhetoricians,
Philostratus, Alciphron, and Libanius, many of whose best
compositions are epigrams in prose&mdash;as Jonson knew when he
turned them into lyrics; their still more intimate &aelig;sthetic harmony
with the engraved stones and minor bass-reliefs, which bear
exactly the same relation to Greek sculpture as the epigrams to
the more august forms of Greek poetry; the lives of their authors;
the historical events to which they not unfrequently allude&mdash;all
these are topics for elaborate dissertation.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the true secret of their charm is this: that
in their couplets, after listening to the choric raptures of triumphant
public art, we turn aside to hear the private utterances, the
harmoniously modulated whispers of a multitude of Greek poets
telling us their inmost thoughts and feelings. The unique melodies
of Meleager, the chaste and exquisite delicacy of Callimachus,
the clear dry style of Straton, Plato's unearthly subtlety of phrase,
Antipater's perfect polish, the good sense of Palladas, the fretful
sweetness of Agathias, the purity of Simonides, the gravity of
Poseidippus, the pointed grace of Philip, the few but mellow
tones of Sappho and Erinna, the tenderness of Simmias, the
biting wit of Lucillius, the sunny radiance of Theocritus&mdash;all
these good things are ours in the Anthology. But beyond these
perfumes of the poets known to fame is yet another. Over very
many of the sweetest and the strongest of the epigrams is written
the pathetic word &#7936;&#948;&#8051;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;&mdash;without a master. Hail to you,
dead poets, unnamed, but dear to the Muses! Surely with Pindar
and with Anacreon and with Sappho and with Sophocles the
bed of flowers is spread for you in those "black-petalled hollows
of Pieria" where Ion bade farewell to Euripides.</p>

There is no very good translation of this couplet. The difficulty lies in the
word &#8165;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;. Is this equivalent to &#8165;&#8053;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;, as Cicero, who renders it by <i>legibus</i>,
seems to think? Or is it the same as <i>orders</i>?</p></div>

Here the essence of this kind of poetry is said to be brevity. But nothing is
said about a sting. And on the point of brevity, the Cyril to whom this
couplet is attributed is far too stringent when judged by the best Greek
standards. The modern notion of the epigram is derived from a study of
Martial, whose best verses are satirical and therefore of necessity stinging.</p></div>

</div></div>

<p>This is the first allusion to a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>story, rather Roman than Greek,
which was destined to play an important part in literature. The
introduction of the fable without names into a poem like the third
Georgic shows, however, that the pathetic tale of Hero and Leander's
love had already found familiar representation in song or
sculpture or wall-painting before Virgil touched it with the genius
that turned all it touched to gold. Ovid went further, and
placed the maiden of Sestos among the heroines for whom he
wrote rhetorical epistles in elegiac verse. In Statius, again, we
get a glimpse of the story translated from the sphere of romance
into the region of antique mythology. To the hero Admetus,
Adrastus gives a mantle dyed with Tyrian purple, and embroidered
with Leander's death. There flows the Hellespont; the
youth is vainly struggling with the swollen waves; and there
stands Hero on her tower; and the lamp already flickers in the
blast that will destroy both light and lives at once. It still remained
for a grammarian of the fifth century, Mus&aelig;us, of whom
nothing but the name is known, to give the final form to this
poem of love and death. The spring-tide of the epic and the
idyl was over. When Mus&aelig;us entered the Heliconian meadows
to pluck this last pure rose of Greek summer, autumn had already
set its silent finger on "bare, ruined choirs, where late the sweet
birds sang." His little poem of three hundred and forty hexameters
is both an epic and an idyl. While maintaining the old
heroic style of narrative by means of repeated lines, it recalls the
sweetness of Theocritus in studied descriptions, dactylic cadences,
and brief reflective sayings that reveal the poet's mind. Like some
engraved gems, the latest products of the glyphic art, this poem
adjusts the breadth of the grand manner to the small scale required
by jewelry, treating a full subject in a narrow space, and in return
endowing sligh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>t motives with dignity by nobleness of handling.</p>

<p>Calm mornings of sunshine visit us at times in early November,
appearing like glimpses of departed spring amid the wilderness
of wet and windy days that lead to winter. It is pleasant,
when these interludes of silvery light occur to ride into the woods
and see how wonderful are all the colors of decay. Overhead, the
elms and chestnuts hang their wealth of golden leaves, while the
beeches darken into russet tones, and the wild-cherry glows like
blood-red wine. In the hedges crimson haws and scarlet hips are
wreathed with hoary clematis or necklaces of coral briony berries;
the brambles burn with many-colored flames; the dog-wood is
bronzed to purple; and here and there the spindle-wood puts
forth its fruit, like knots of rosy buds, on delicate frail twigs.
Underneath lie fallen leaves, and the brown brake rises to our
knees as we thread the forest paths. Everything is beautiful
with beauty born of over-ripeness and decline. Green summer
comes no more this year, at any rate. In front are death and
bareness and the winter's frost.</p>

<p>Such a day of sunlight in the November of Greek poetry is
granted to us by <i>Hero and Leander</i>. The grace of the poem is
soul-compelling&mdash;indescribable for sweetness. Yet every epithet,
each exquisite conceit, and all the studied phrases that yield charm,
remind us that the end has come. There is peculiar pathos in
this autumnal loveliness of literature upon the wane. In order to
appreciate it fully we must compare the mellow tints of Mus&aelig;us
with the morning glory of Homer or of Pindar. We then find
that, in spite of so much loss, in spite of warmth and full light
taken from us, and promise of the future exchanged for musings
on the pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>st, a type of beauty unattainable by happier poets of the
spring has been revealed. Not to accept this grace with thanksgiving,
because, forsooth, December, that takes all away, is close
at hand, would be ungrateful.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Yet, though clearly perceptible by the &aelig;sthetic sense, it is far
less easy to define its quality than to miss it altogether. We do
not gain much, for example, by pointing to the reminiscences of
bygone phraseology curiously blended with new forms of language,
to the artificial subtleties of rhythm wrung from well-worn
metres, to the richness of effect produced by conscious use of
telling images, to the iridescent shimmer of mixed metaphors,
compound epithets, and daring tropes, contrasted with the undertone
of sadness which betrays the "idle singer of an empty day,"
although these elements are all combined in the autumnal style.
Nor will it profit us to distinguish this kind of beauty from the
<i>beaut&eacute; maladive</i> of morbid art. So difficult, indeed, is it to seize
its character with any certainty, that in the case of <i>Hero and Leander</i>
the uncritical scholars of the Greek Renaissance mistook
the evening for the morning star of Greek poetry, confounding
Mus&aelig;us the grammarian with the semi-mythic bard of the Orphean
age. When Aldus Manutius conceived his great idea of issuing
Greek literature entire from the Venetian press, he put forth
<i>Hero and Leander</i> first of all in 1498, with a preface that ran as
follows: "I was desirous that Mus&aelig;us, the most ancient poet,
should form a prelude to Aristotle and the other sages who will
shortly be imprinted at my hands." Marlowe spoke of "divine
Mus&aelig;us," and even the elder Scaliger saw no reason to suspect
that the grammarian's studied verse was not the first clear woodnote
of the Eleusinian singer. What renders this mistake pardonable
is the fact that, however autumnal may be the poem's
charm, no point of the genuine Greek youthfulness of fancy has
been lost. Through conceits, confusions of diction, and ove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>rsweetness
of style emerges the clear outline which characterized
Greek art in all its periods. Both persons and situations are
plastically treated&mdash;subjected, that is to say, to the conditions best
fulfilled by sculpture. The emotional element is adequate to the
imaginative presentation; the feeling penetrates the form and
gives it life, without exceeding the just limits which the form imposes.
The importance of this observation will appear when we
examine the same poem romantically handled by our own Marlowe.
If nothing but the <i>Hero and Leander</i> of Mus&aelig;us had survived
the ruin of Greek literature, we should still be able to distinguish
how Greek poets dealt with their material, and to point
the difference between the classic and the modern styles.</p>

<p>What is truly admirable in this poem, marking it as genuinely
Greek, is the simplicity of structure, clearness of motives, and unaffected
purity of natural feeling. The first fifteen lines set forth,
by way of proem, the whole subject:</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, a modern poet might have stayed his hand: not
so Mus&aelig;us; he has still to say that he will tell of Leander's death,

<p>Seven lines were enough for Homer while explaining the subject
of the <i>Iliad</i>. Mus&aelig;us, though his poem is so short, wants
more than twice as many. He cannot resist the temptation to
introduce decorative passages like the three lines just quoted,
which are, moreover, appropriate in a poem that aims at combining
the idyllic and epic styles.</p>

<p>After the proem we enter on the story. Sestos and Abydos are
divided by the sea, but Love has joined them with an arrow from
his bow:</p>

<p>Hero dwelt at Sestos; Leander lived at Abydos; and both were
"exceeding fair stars of the two cities." By the sea, outside the
town of Sestos, Hero had a tower, where she abode in solitude
with one old servant, paying her daily orisons to Dame Kupris,
whose maiden votary she was, and sprinkling the altars of Love
with incense to propitiate his powerful deity. "Still even thus
she did not shun his fire-breathing shafts;" for so it happened
that when the festival of Adonis came round, and the women
flocked into the town to worship, and the youths to gaze upon
the maidens, Hero passed forth that day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> Venus's temple, and
all the men beheld her beauty, and praised her for a goddess, and
desired her for a bride. Leander, too, was there; and Leander
could not content himself, like the rest, with distant admiration:</p>

<p>So far one hundred and nine lines of the poem have carried us.
The following one hundred and eleven lines, nearly a third of the
whole, are devoted to the scene in the temple between Hero and
her lover. This forms by far the most beautiful section of the
tale; for the attention is concentrated on the boy and girl between
whom love at first sight has just been born. In the twilight
of early evening, in the recesses of the shrine, they stand

his passionate insistance, her gradual yielding, are described in a
series of exquisite and artful scenes, wherein the truth of a natural
situation is enhanced by rare and curious touches. With genuine
Greek instinct the poet has throughout been mindful to present
both lovers clearly to the eye, so that a succession of pictures
support and illustrate the dialogue, which rises at the climax to a
love-duet. The descriptive lines are very simple, like these:</p>

<p>A modern poet would have sought to spiritualize the situation:
in the hands of the Greek artist it remains quite natural; it is the
beauty of Leander that persuades and subdues Hero to love, and
the agitations of her soul are expressed in language which suggests
a power that comes upon her from without. At the same
time there is no suspicion of levity or sensuality. Hero cannot
be mistaken for a light of love. When the time comes, she will
break her heart upon the dead body of the youth who wins her
by his passion and his beauty. Leander has hitherto been only
anxious to possess her for his own. Hero, as soon as she perceives
that he has won the fight, bethinks her with a woman's
wisdom of ways and means. Who is the strange man to whom
she must abandon herself in wedlock; and what does he know
about her; and how can they meet? Therefore she tells him her
name and describes her dwelling:</p>

and blames her over-hasty tongue. But Leander, pondering how

and the healer of the heart in one. He bursts into a passionate
protestation: "Maiden, for the love of thee I will cross the stormy
waves; yea, though the waters blaze with fire, and the sea be unsailed
by ships. Only do thou light a lamp upon thy tower to
guide me through the gloom:</p>

<p>Seeing its spark, I shall not need the north star or Orion. And
now, if thou wouldst have my name, know that I am Leander,
husband of the fair-crowned Hero."</p>

<p>Nothing now remains for the lovers but to arrange the
signs and seasons of their future meeting. Then Hero retires
to her tower, and Leander returns to Abydos by the Hellespont:</p>

<p>It may be said in passing that this parting scene, though briefly
narrated, is no less well conducted, <i>wohl motivirt</i>, as Goethe would
have phrased it, than are all the other incidents of the poem (lines
221-231). The interpretation of the passage turns upon the
word &#960;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#948;&#945;&#962;, in line 225, which must here be taken to mean
the vigil before marriage.</p>

<p>At this point the action turns. Mus&aelig;us, having to work within
a narrow space, has made the meeting and the dialogue between
the lovers disproportionate to the length of the whole piece. In
this way he secures our sympathy for the youth and maid, whom
we learn to know as living persons. He can now afford to drop
superfluous links, and to compress the tale within strict limits.
The cunning of his art is shown by the boldness of the transition
to the next important incident. The night and the day are supposed
to have passed. We hear nothing of the impatience of
Leander or of Hero's flux and reflux of contending feelings. The
narrative is resumed just as though the old thread had been broken
and another had been spun; and yet there is no sense of interruption:</p>

<p>There she washes the stain and saltness of the sea from his body,
and anoints him with perfumed oil, and leads him with tender
words of welcome to the marriage-bed. The classic poet feels no
need of apologizing for the situation, nor does he care to emphasize
it. The whole is narrated with Homeric directness, contrasting
curiously with the romantic handling of the same incident by
Marlowe. Yet the point and pathos of clandestine marriage had
to be expressed; and to a Greek the characteristi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>c circumstance
was the absence of customary ritual. This defect, while it isolated
the lovers from domestic sympathies and troops of friends,
attracted attention to themselves, and gave occasion to some of

<p>So the night passed, and through many summer nights they
tasted the sweets of love, &#967;&#955;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7984;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#955;&#8051;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#953;&#957;. But
soon came winter, and with winter the sea grew stormy, and ships
were drawn up on the beach, and the winds battled with each
other in the Hellespontine Straits; and now Hero should have
refrained from lighting her lamp, &#956;&#953;&#957;&#965;&#8061;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945; &#955;&#8051;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#957;: but
love and fate compelled her, and the night of tempest and of destiny
arrived. Manfully Leander wrestled with the waves; yet
the storm grew stronger; his st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>rength ebbed away, an envious
gust blew out the guiding lamp; and so he perished in the waters.
The picture of his death-struggle is painted with brief incisive
touches. The last two lines have a strange unconscious
pathos in them, as though the life and love of a man were no better
than a candle:</p>

<p>What remains to be told is but little. The cold gray dawn
went forth upon the sea; how gray and comfortless they know
who, after lonely watching through night hours, have seen discolored
breakers beat upon a rainy shore. Hero from her turret
gazed through the twilight; and there at her feet lay dead Leander,
bruised by the rocks and buffeted by slapping waves. She
uttered no cry; but tore the embroidered raiment on her breast,
and flung herself, face downward, from the lofty tower. In their
death, says the poet after his own fashion, they were not divided:</p>

</div></div>

<p>This line ends the poem.</p>

<p>This is but a simple story. Yet for that very reason it is one
of those stories which can never grow old. As Leigh Hunt, after
some unnecessary girding at scholars and sculptors, has sung:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never think of poor Leander's fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he swam, and how his bride sat late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched the dreadful dawning of the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as I would of two that died last night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So might they now have lived, and so have died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The story's heart, to me, still beats against its side.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What makes it doubly touching is, that this poem of young love
and untimely fate was born, like a soul "beneath the ribs of
death," in the dotage and decay of Greek art. I do not know
whether it has often been noticed that the qualities of romantic
grace and pathos were chiefly appreciated by the Greeks in their
decline. It is this circumstance, perhaps, which caused the tales
of <i>Hero and Leander</i> and <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i> to attract so much
attention at the time of the Renaissance. Modern students found
something akin to their own modes of feeling in the later classics.
Are not the colors of the autumn in harmony with the tints of
spring?</p>

<p>The judicious Hallam, in a famous passage of the <i>History of
Literature</i>, records his opinion that "it is impossible not to wish
that Shakespeare had never written" the sonnets dedicated to Mr.
W. H. With the same astounding &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8055;&#945;, or insensibility to
beauty, he ventures to d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>ismiss the <i>Hero and Leander</i> of Marlowe
as "a paraphrase, in every sense of the epithet, of the most licentious
kind." Yet this severe high-priest of decorum has devoted
three pages and a half to the analysis of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, in
which play we have, as he remarks with justice, "more than in
any other tragedy, the mere passion of love; love, in all its vernal
promise, full of hope and innocence, ardent beyond all restraint
of reason, but tender as it is warm." What can be said of the
critical perceptions of one who finds so strongly marked a moral
separation between the motives of Marlowe's poem and Shakespeare's
play?</p>

<p>The truth is that the words used by Hallam to characterize the
subject of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> are almost exactly applicable to <i>Hero
and Leander</i>, after due allowance made for the distinction between
the styles of presentation proper to a tragedy in the one
case, and in the other to a narrative poem. Reflecting upon this,
it is probable that the impartial student will side with Swinburne
when he writes: "I must avow that I want, and am well content
to want, the sense, whatever it be, which would enable me to discern
more offence in that lovely picture of the union of two lovers
in body as in soul than I can discern in the parting of Romeo
and Juliet."</p>

<p>To discuss the morality of Marlowe's muse is, however, alien to
the present purpose. What has to be brought plainly forward is
the artistic difference between the methods of Marlowe and Mus&aelig;us.
Hallam, in calling the English <i>Hero and Leander</i> a "paraphrase,"
was hardly less wrong than Warton, who called it a "translation."
It is, in fact, a free and independent reproduction of the
story first told by Mus&aelig;us. Without the poem of Mus&aelig;us the
poem of Marlowe would not have existed; but though the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>incidents
remain unchanged, the whole manner of presenting them, of
selecting characteristic details, and of guiding the sympathy and
imagination of the reader is altered. In other words, the artistic
consciousness had shifted its point of gravity between the ages of
Mus&aelig;us and Marlowe, and a new poem was produced to satisfy
the new requirements of the &aelig;sthetic ideal. Mus&aelig;us, as we have
already seen, thought it essential to set forth the whole of his
subject at the opening in its minutest details: Sestos and Abydos,
the marriage-bed on which the morning never shone, the swimming
feat of Leander, and the lamp, which was the star of love,
till envious fate blew out both love and light and life itself together,
all find their proper place in the proemium. In conducting
the narrative he is careful to present each motive, as it were,
from the outside, to cast the light of his imagination upon forms
rendered as distinct as possible in their plasticity, just as the sun's
light falls upon and renders visible a statue. There is no attempt
to spiritualize the subject, to flood it with emotion, thought, and
passion, to pierce into its inmost substance, to find the analogue
to its implicit feeling in the depth of his own soul, and, by expressing
that, to place his readers at the point of view from which
he contemplates the beauty of the fable. The poet withdraws
his personality, leaving the animated figures he has put upon the
stage of fancy, the carefully prepared situations that display their
activity, and the words invented for them, to tell the tale. He
can therefore afford to be both simple and direct, brief in descriptive
passages, and free from psychological digressions. A few
gnomic sentences, here and there introduced, suffice to maintain
the reflective character of a meditated work of art. All this is in
perfect concord with the Greek conception of art, the sculpturesque
ideal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>
<p>Marlowe takes another course. The three hundred and forty
lines which were enough for Mus&aelig;us are expanded into six sestiads
or cantos, each longer than the whole Greek poem.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Yet to
this lengthy narrative no prelude is prefixed. Unlike Mus&aelig;us,
Marlowe rushes at once into the story. He does not wait to propound
it, or to talk about the fatal lamp, or to describe Hero's
tower. That Hero lived in a tower at all we only discover by accident
on the occasion of her visit to the shrine of Venus, and
Leander makes his first appearance there, guided by no lamp, but
by his own audacity. On the other hand, all descriptions that set
free the poet's feeling are enormously extended. The one epithet
&#7985;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#949;&#953;&#962;, or love-inspiring, for instance, which satisfied Mus&aelig;us, is
amplified by Marlowe through forty lines throbbing with his own
deep sense of adolescent beauty. The temple of Venus, briefly
alluded to by Mus&aelig;us, is painted in detail by Marlowe, with a luminous
account of its frescos, bass-reliefs, and pavements. The
first impassioned speech of Leander runs at one breath over ninety-six
verses, while mythological episodes and moral reflections
are freely interpolated. All the situations, however delicate, so
long as they have raised the poet's sense of beauty to enthusiasm,
are treated with elaborate and loving sympathy. In presenting
them with their fulness of emotion to the reader, Marlowe taxes
his inexhaustible invention to the utmost, and permits the luxuriance
of his fancy to run riot. The passion which carries this soul
of fire and air up to the empyrean, where it moves at ease, sometimes
betrays him into what we know as faults of taste. It is as
though the love-ache, grown intense, had passed over for a moment
into pain, as though the music, seeking for subtler and still
more subtle harmonies, had touched at times on discord.</p>

<p>Compared with the Greek poem, this <i>Hero and Leander</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a><br /><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
Marlowe is like some radiant double-rose placed side by side with
the wild-brier whence it sprang by cultivation. The petals have
been multiplied, the perfume deepened and intensified, the colors
varied in their modulations of a single tint. At the same time
something in point of simple form has been sacrificed. The first
thing, then, that strikes us in turning from Mus&aelig;us to Marlowe is
that what the Greek poet considered all-important in the presentation
of his subject has been dropped or negligently handled by
the English, while the English poet has been prodigal in places
where the Greek displayed his parsimony. On looking further,
we discover that the modern poet, in all these differences, aims at
effects not realized by ancient art. The life and play and actual
pulsations of emotion have to be revealed, both as they exist in
the subject of the poem and as the poet finds them in his own
soul. Everything that will contribute to this main achievement
is welcomed by the poet, and the rest rejected. All the motives
which had an external statuesque significance for the Greek must
palpitate with passion for the English. Those that cannot clothe
themselves with spirit as with a garment are abandoned. He
wants to make his readers feel, not see: if they see at all, they
must see through their emotion; whereas the emotion of the
Greek was stirred in him through sight. We do not get very far
into the matter, but we gain something, perhaps, by adding that
as sculpture is to painting and music, so is the poetry of Mus&aelig;us
to that of Marlowe. In the former, feeling is subordinate, or, at
most, but adequate, to form; in the latter, <i>Gef&uuml;hl ist alles</i>.</p>

<p>What has just been advanced is stated broadly, and is therefore
only accurate in a general sense. For while the Greek <i>Leander</i>
contains exquisite touches of pure sentiment, so the English <i>Leander</i>
offers fully perfected pictures of Titianesque beauty. Still,
this does not impair the strength of the position: what is really
instructive in the comparative study of the two tales of <i>Hero and
Leander</i> will always be that the elder poem, in spite of its autumnal
quality, is classical; the younger, in spite of its most utter paganism,
is romantic. To enter into minute criticism of Marlowe's
poem would be out of place here; and, were it included in my
programme, I should shrink from this task as a kind of profanation.
Those who have the true sense of ideal beauty, and who
can rise by sympathy above the commonplaces of every-day life
into the free atmosphere of art, which is nature permeated with
emotion, will never forget the prolonged, recurring, complex cadences
of that divinest dithyramb poured forth from a young
man's soul. Every form and kind of beauty is included in his
adoration, and the whole is spiritualized with imagination, ardent
and passionate beyond all words.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<i>THE GENIUS OF GREEK ART.</i></h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Separation between the Greeks and us.&mdash;Criticism.&mdash;Greek Sense of Beauty.&mdash;Greek
Morality.&mdash;Greece, Rome, Renaissance, the Modern Spirit.</p></div>


<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Greeks had no past, "no hungry generations trod them
down;" whereas the multitudinous associations of immense antiquity
envelop all our thoughts and feelings.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> "O Solon, Solon,"
said the priest of Egypt, "you Greeks are always children!" The
world has now grown old; we are gray from the cradle onwards,
swathed with the husks of outworn creeds, and rocked upon the
lap of immemorial mysteries. The travail of the whole earth, the
unsatisfied desires of many races, the anguish of the death and
birth of successive civilizations, have passed into our souls. Life
itself has become a thousandfold more complicated and more
difficult for us than it was in the spring-time of the world. With
the increase of the size of nations, poverty and disease and the
struggle for bare existence have been aggravated. How can we,
then, bridge over the gulf which separates us from the Greeks?
How shall we, whose souls are aged and wrinkled with the long
years of humanity, shake hands across the centuries with those
young-eyed, young-limbed, immortal children? Can we make
criticism our Medea&mdash;bid the magnificent witch pluck leaves and
flowers of Greek poetry and art and life, distilling them for us to
bathe therein and regenerate our youth like &AElig;son?</p>

<p>Like a young man newly come from the wrestling-ground,
anointed, chapleted, and very calm, the Genius of the Greeks appears
before us. Upon his soul there is as yet no burden of the
world's pain; the creation that groaneth and travaileth together
has touched him with no sense of anguish, nor has he yet felt sin.
The pride and the strength of adolescence are his&mdash;audacity and
endurance, swift passions and exquisite sensibilities, the alternations
of sublime repose and boyish noise, grace, pliancy, and stubbornness
and power, love of all fair things and radiant in the
world, the frank enjoyment of the open air, free merriment, and
melancholy well beloved. Of these adolescent qualities, of this
clear and stainless personality, this conscience whole and pure and
reconciled to nature, what survives among us now? The imagination
must be strained to the uttermost before we can begin to
sympathize with such a being. The blear-eyed mechanic, stifled
in a hovel of our sombre Northern towns, canopied through all the
year with smoke, deafened with wheels that never cease to creak,
stiffened by toil in one cramped posture, oblivious of the sunlight
and green fields, could scarcely be taught even to envy the pure,
clear life of art made perfect in humanity, which was the pride
of Hellas. His soul is gladdened, if at all, by a glimpse of celestial
happiness far off. The hope that went abroad across the
earth so many centuries ago has raised his eyes to heaven. How
can he comprehend a mode of existence in which the world itself
was adequate to all the wants of the soul, and when to yearn for
more than life affords was reckoned a disease?</p>

<p>We may tell of blue &AElig;gean waves, islanded with cliffs that
seem less real than clouds, whereon the temples stand, burning
like gold in sunset or turning snowy fronts against the dawn.
We may paint high porches of the gods, resonant with music and
gladdened with choric dances; or describe perpetual sunshine and
perpetual ease&mdash;no work from year to year that might degrade the
body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> or impair the mind, no dread of hell, no yearning after heaven,
but summer-time of youth and autumn of old age and loveless
death bewept and bravely borne.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The life of the schools, the
theatre, the wrestling-ground, the law-courts; generous contests on
the Pythian or Olympian plains; victorious crowns of athletes or
of patriots; Simonidean epitaphs and funeral orations of Pericles
for fallen heroes; the prize of martial prowess or poetic skill; the
honor paid to the pre-eminence of beauty&mdash;all these things admit
of scholar-like enumeration. Or we may recall by fancy the olive-groves
of the Academy; discern Hymettus pale against the burnished
sky, and Athens guarded by her glistening goddess of
the mighty brow&mdash;Pallas, who spreads her shield and shakes
her spear above the labyrinth of peristyles and pediments in
which her children dwell. Imagination can lead us to the
plane-trees on Cephisus's shore, the labors of the husbandmen
who garner dues of corn and oil, the galleys in Peir&aelig;an harborage.
Or, with the Lysis and the Charmides beneath our eyes, we
may revisit the haunts of the wrestlers and the runners, true-born
Athenians, fresh from the bath and crowned with violets&mdash;chaste,
vigorous, inured to rhythmic movements of the passions and the
soul.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, when the process of an elaborate culture has thus
been toilsomely accomplished, when we have trained our soul to
sympathize with that which is so novel and so strange and yet so
natural, few of us can fairly say that we have touched the Greeks
at more than one or two points. <i>Novies Styx interfusa coercet</i>:
between us and them crawls the nine times twisted stream of
death. The history of the human race is one; and without the
Greeks we should be nothing. But just as an old man of ninety
is not the same being as the boy of nineteen&mdash;nay, cannot even
recall to memory how and what he felt when the pulse of manhood
was yet gathering strength within his veins&mdash;even so now
civilized humanity looks back upon the youth of Hellas and wonders
what she was in that blest time.</p>

<p>A few fragments yet remain from which we strive to reconstruct
the past. Criticism is the product of the weakness as well
as of the strength of our age. In the midst of our activity we
have so little that is artistically salient or characteristic in our life
that we are not led astray by our own individuality or tempted to
interpret the past wrongly by making it square with the present.
Impartial clearness of judgment in scientific research, laborious
antiquarian zeal, methodic scrupulousness in preserving the minutest
details of local coloring, and an earnest craving to escape
from the dreary present of commonplace routine and drudgery
into the spirit-stirring freedom of the past&mdash;these are qualities of
the highest value which our century has brought to bear upon
history. They make up in some measure for our want of the
creative faculties which more productive but less scientific ages
have possessed, and enable those who have but little original imagination
to enjoy imaginative plea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sures at second hand by living
as far as may be in the clear light of antique beauty.</p>

<p>The sea, the hills, the plains, the sunlight of the South, together
with some ruins which have peopled Europe with phantoms of
dead art, and the relics of Greek literature, are our guides in the
endeavor to restore the past of Hellas. Among rocks golden with
broom-flowers, murmurous with bees, burning with anemones in
spring and oleanders in summer, and odorous through all the year
with thyme, we first assimilate the spirit of the Greeks. It is here
that we divine the meaning of the myths, and feel those poems
that expressed themselves in marble mid the temples of the gods
to have been the one right outgrowth from the sympathy of man,
as he was then, with nature. In the silence of mountain valleys
thinly grown with arbutus and pine and oak, open at all seasons
to pure air, and breaking downwards to the sea, we understand the
apparition of Pan to Pheidippides, we read the secret of a nation's
art that aimed at definition before all things. The bay of Naples,
the coast of Sicily, are instinct with the sense of those first settlers,
who, coasting round the silent promontories, ran their keels
upon the shelving shore, and drew them up along the strand, and
named the spot Neapolis or Gela. The boys of Rome were yet in
the wolf's cavern. Vesuvius was a peaceful hill on which the
olive and the vine might slumber. The slopes of Pozzuoli were
green with herbs, over which no lava had been poured. Wandering
about Sorrento, the spirit of the <i>Odyssey</i> is ours. Those fishing-boats
with lateen sail are such as bore the heroes from their
ten years' toil at Troy. Those shadowy islands caught the gaze
of &AElig;neas straining for the promised land. Into such clefts and
rents of rock strode Herakles and Jason when they sought the
golden apples and the golden fleece. Look down. There gleam
the green and yellow dragon-scales, coiled on the basement of the
hills, and writhing to each curve and cleavage of the chasm. Is
it a dream? Do we in fact behold the mystic snake, or in the twilight
do those lustrous orange-trees deceive our eyes? Nay, there
are no dragons in the ravine&mdash;only thick boughs and burnished
leaves and snowy bloom and globes of glittering gold. Above
them on the cliff sprout myrtle-rods, sacred to Love, myrtle-branches,
with which the Athenians wreathed their swords in
honor of Harmodius. Lilies and jonquils and hyacinths stand,
each straight upon his stem&mdash;a youth, as Greeks imagined, slain
by his lover's hand, or dead for love of his own loveliness,
or cropped in love's despite by death that is the foe of love.
Scarlet and white anemones are there, some born of Adonis's
blood, and some of Aphrodite's tears. All beauty fades;
the flowers of earth, the bloom of youth, man's strength, and
woman's grace, all wither and relapse into the loveless and inexorable
grave. This the Greeks knew, mingling mirth with melancholy,
and love with sadness, their sweetest songs with elegiac
melodies.</p>

<p>Beneath the olive-trees, among the flowers and ferns, move
stately maidens and bare-chested youths. Their eyes are starry-softened
or flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> fire, and their lips are parted to drink in the
breath of life. Some are singing in the fields an antique, world-old
monotone of song. Was not the lay of Linus, the burden of
&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#961;&#8059;&#949;&#962; &#8038; &#924;&#949;&#957;&#8049;&#955;&#954;&#945; (High are the oak-trees, O Menalcas),
some such canzonet as this? These late descendants of Greek
colonists are still beautiful&mdash;like moving statues in the sunlight
and the shadow of the boughs. Yonder tall, straight girl, whose
pitcher, poised upon her head, might have been filled by Electra
or Chrysothemis with lustral waters for a father's tomb, carries
her neck as nobly as a Fate of Pheidias. Her body sways upon
the hips, where rests her modelled arm; the ankle and the foot
are sights to sit and gaze at through a summer's day. And
where, if not here, shall we meet with Hylas and Hyacinth, with
Ganymede and Hymen&aelig;us, in the flesh? As we pass the laughter
and the singing die away. Bright dresses and pliant forms
are lost. We stray onward through the sheen and shade of olive-branches.</p>

<p>The olive was Athene's gift to Hellas, and Athens carved its
leaves and berries on her drachma with the head of Pallas and her
owl. The light which never leaves its foliage, silvery beneath and
sparkling from the upper surface of burnished green, the delicacy
of its stem, which in youth and middle and old age retains the distinction
of finely accentuated form, the absence of sombre shadow
on the ground beneath its branches, might well fit the olive to be
the symbol of the purity of classic art. Each leaf is cut into a
lance-head of brilliancy, not jagged or fanciful or woolly like the
foliage of Northern trees. There is here no mystery of darkness,
no labyrinth of tortuous shade, no conflict of contrasted forms.
Excess of light sometimes fatigues the eye amid those airy
branches, and we long for the repose of gloom to which we are
accustomed in our climate. But gracefulness, fertility, power, radiance,
pliability, are seen in every line. The spirit of the Greeks
itself is not more luminous and strong and subtle. The color of
the olive-tree, again, is delicate. Its pearly grays and softened
greens in nowise interfere with the lustre which is the true distinction
of the tree. Clear and faint like Guido's colors in the
Ariadne of St. Luke's at Rome, distinct as the thought in a Greek
epigram, the olive-branches are relieved against the bright blue of
the sea. The mountain slopes above are clothed by them with
light as with a raiment; clinging to knoll and vale and winding
creek, rippling in hoary undulations to the wind, they wrap the
hills from feet to flank in lucid haze. Above the olives shine bare
rocks in steady noon or blush with dawn and evening.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Nature
is naked and beautiful beneath the sun&mdash;like Aphrodite, whose
raiment falls waist-downward to her sandals on the sea, but whose
pure breasts and forehead are unveiled.</p>

<p>Nature is thus the first, chief element by which we are enabled
to conceive the spirit of the Greeks. The key to their mythology
is here. Here is the secret of their sympathies, the well-spring of
their deepest thoughts, the primitive potentiality of al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>l they have
achieved in art. What is Apollo but the magic of the sun whose
soul is light? What is Aphrodite but the love-charm of the sea?
What is Pan but the mystery of nature, the felt and hidden want
pervading all? What, again, are those elder, dimly discovered
deities, the Titans and the brood of Time, but forces of the world
as yet beyond the touch and ken of human sensibilities? But
nature alone cannot inform us what that spirit was. For though
the Greeks grew up in scenes which we may visit, they gazed on
them with Greek eyes, eyes different from ours, and dwelt upon
them with Greek minds, minds how unlike our own! Unconsciously,
in their long and unsophisticated infancy, the Greeks absorbed
and assimilated to their own substance that loveliness
which it is left for us only to admire. Between them and ourselves&mdash;even
face to face with mountain, sky, and sea, unaltered by
the lapse of years&mdash;flow the rivers of Death and Lethe and New
Birth, and the mists of thirty centuries of human life are woven
like a veil. To pierce that veil, to learn even after the most partial
fashion how they transmuted the splendors of the world into
&aelig;sthetic forms, is a work which involves the further interrogation
of their sculpture and their literature.</p>

<p>The motives of that portion of Greek sculpture which bring us
close to the incidents of Greek life are very simple. A young
man binding a fillet round his head; a boy drawing a thorn from
his foot; a girl who has been wounded in the breast raising her
arm to show where the sword smote her; an athlete bending every
sinew to discharge the quoit; a line of level-gazing youths on
prancing horses, some faring forward with straight eyes, one turning,
with bridle-hand held tightly, to encourage his companion, another
with loose mantle in the act to mount, others thrown back
to rein upon their haunches chafing steeds; a procession of
draped maidens bearing urns; a maiden, draped from neck to ankle,
holding in both hands a lustral vase&mdash;such are the sculptured
signs by which we read the placid physical fulfilment of Greek
life. That the serenity of satisfied existence is an end in itself,
and that death in the plenitude of vigor is desirable, the reliefs
of Pheidias and the &AElig;ginetan marbles teach us. In these simple
but consummate works of art the beauty of pure health, physical
enjoyment, temperance, mental vigor, and heroic daring mingle and
create one splendor of a human being sensitive to all influences
and vital in every faculty. Excess can nowhere be discovered.
Compare with these forms for a moment the Genii painted by
Michael Angelo upon the roof of the Sistine Chapel. Over them
has passed the spirit with its throes: <i>la maladie de la pens&eacute;e</i> is
there. Of no Ph&#339;bus and no Pallas are they the servants; but
ministers of prophets and sibyls, angels of God fulfilling his word,
they incarnate the wrestlings and the judgments and the resurrections
of the soul. Now take a banquet-scene from some Greek
vase. Along the cushioned couch lie young men, naked, crowned
with myrtles; in their laps are women, and at their sides broad
jars of honeyed wine. A winged Eros hovers over them, and their
lips are<span class="pagenum"><a name="iPage_9" id="iPage_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> opened to sing a song of ancient love. Yet this is no
forecast of Borgia revels in Rome, or of the French Regent's Parc
aux Cerfs. When Autolycus entered the symposium of Xenophon,
all tongues were stricken dumb; man gazed at man in wonder at
his goodliness. When Charmides, heading the troop of wrestlers,
joined Socrates in the pal&aelig;stra, the soul of the philosopher was
troubled; such beauty was for him a sacred, spirit-shaking thing.
Sim&aelig;tha, in the <i>Pharmaceutria</i> of Theocritus, beheld the curls of
youths on horseback like laburnum-flowers, and their bosoms
whiter than the moon.</p>

<p>We need not embark on antiquarian or metaphysical or historical
discussions in order to understand the sense of beauty which
was inherent in the Greeks. Little hints scattered by the wayside
are far more helpful. Take, for example, the <i>Clouds</i> of Aristophanes;
and after reading the speech of the Dikaios Logos, stand
beneath the Athlete of Lysippus,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> in the Braccio Nuovo of the
Vatican. "Fresh and fair in beauty-bloom you shall pass your
days in the wrestling-ground, or run races beneath the sacred
olive-trees, crowned with white reed, in company with a pure-hearted
friend, smelling of bindweed and leisure hours and the
white poplar that sheds her leaves, rejoicing in the prime of spring,
when the plane-tree whispers to the lime." This life the Dikaios
Logos offers to the young Athenian if he will forego the law-courts
and the lectures of the sophists and the house of the hetaira. This
life rises above us imaged in the sculptor's marble. The athlete,
tall and stately, tired with healthy exercise, lifts one arm, and with
his strigil scrapes away the oil with which he has anointed it. His
fingers hold the die that tells his number in the contest. Upon
his features there rests no shade of care or thought, but the delicious
languor of momentary fatigue, and the serenity of a nature
in harmony with itself. A younger brother of the same lineage is
the Adorante of the Berlin Museum. His eyes and arms are
raised to heaven. Perfect in humanity, beneath the lightsome
vault of heaven he stands and prays&mdash;a prayer of joy and calm
thanksgiving, a Greek prayer&mdash;no Roman adoration with veiled
eyes and muttering lips, no Jewish prostration with the putting-off
of sandals on the holy ground, no Christian genuflection like
the bending of wind-smitten reeds beneath the spirit-breath of
sacraments. The whirlwind of the mightiest religions, born in the
mystic East, has not passed over him; he has not searched their
depths of awe, their heights of ecstasy, nor felt their purifying
fires. Iamos in the mid-waves of Alpheus might have prayed thus
when he heard the voice of Ph&#339;bus calling to him and promising
the twofold gift of prophecy. All the statues of the athletes
bear the seal and blossom of &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&mdash;that truly Greek virtue,
the correlative in morals to the passion for beauty. "When I
with justice on my lips flourished," says the Dikaios Logos, "and
modesty was held in honor, then a boy's voice was not heard; but
they went orderly through the streets in bands together from their
quarters to the harp-player's school, uncloaked and ba<span class="pagenum"><a name="iPage_10" id="iPage_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>refoot, even
though it snowed like meal." Of this sort are the two wrestling
boys at Florence, whose strained muscles exhibit the chord of masculine
vigor vibrating with tense vitality. If we in England seek
some living echo of this melody of curving lines we must visit the
water meadows where boys bathe in early morning, or the playgrounds
of our public schools in summer, or the banks of the Isis
when the eights are on the water, or the riding-schools of soldiers.
We cannot reconstitute the elements of Greek life; but here and
there we may gain hints for adding breath and pulse and movement
to Greek sculpture. What for the Greeks was a permanent
and normal condition is for us an accident. Therefore our conception
of existence&mdash;more intense in emotion, more profound, perhaps,
in thought&mdash;contains an element of strife and pain, an interruption
of the purely physical harmony, which the Greek ideal
lacked.</p>

<p>The charm which the simplest things acquired under the hand
of a Greek artificer may be seen in the adornment of a circular
hand-mirror.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Ivy-branches, dividing both ways from the handle,
surround its rim with a delicate tracery of sharp-cut leaf and
corymb. The central space is occupied by four figures&mdash;on the
right, the boy Dionysus, who welcomes his mother in heaven; on
the left, Ph&#339;bus and a young Paniscus playing on the double
pipes. Grace can go no further than in the attitude and the expression
of this group. Dionysus is thrown backward; both his
arms are raised to encircle the neck of Semele, who bends to kiss
his upturned lips. A necklace with pendent balls defines the
throat of the stripling where it meets his breast, suggesting by
some touch beyond analysis the life that pulses in his veins. He
has armlets too below the elbow, and his hair ripples in ringlets
between cheek and shoulder. The little Paniscus is seated, attending
only to his music, with such childish earnestness as shows
that his whole soul goes forth in piping. Ph&#339;bus, half-draped
and lustrous, stands erect beside a slender shaft of laurel planted
on the ground. Such are the delights of Paradise to which, as
Greeks imagined, a deity might welcome his earthly mother, leading
her by the hand from Hades. It would be easy enough to
fill a volume with such descriptions&mdash;to unlock the cabinets of
gems and coins, or to linger over vases painted with the single
figure of a winged boy in tender red upon their blackness, and
showing the word &#922;&#913;&#923;&#927;&#931; negligently written at the side.</p>

<p>But it is more to the purpose to note in passing that delicate
perception of associated qualities which led the Greeks to maintain
a sympathy between cognate deities, while dist<span class="pagenum"><a name="iPage_11" id="iPage_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>inguishing to
the utmost their specific attributes. Aphrodite, Eros, Dionysus,
Hermes, Hermaphrodite, the Graces, the Nymphs, the Genius of
Death&mdash;these, for example, though carefully individualized, are
still of one kindred. They blend and mingle in a concord of separate
yet interpenetrating beauties. Between the radiant Aphrodite
of Melos, who in her triumphant attitude seems to be an
elder sister of the brazen-winged Victory of Brescia, and the voluptuous
Aphrodite Callipygos,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> a whole rhythm of finely modulated
forms may be drawn out, each one of which corresponds
to some mood or moment of the enamoured soul. Her immortal
son in the Eros of Pheidias<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> is imagined as the "first of gods,"
&#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;, upstarting in his slenderness of youth from Chaos&mdash;the
keen, fine light of dawn dividing night from day. In the
Praxitelean Cupid&mdash;</p>

<p>he becomes the deity described by Plato in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>, an incarnation
of passion, tinged, in spite of his own radiance, with
sadness. What thought has made him sorrowful and bowed his
head? Perhaps Theognis can tell us:</p>

<p>The winged boy, again, bending his bow against the hearts of lovers,
with his lion's skin beside him,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> is the Eros of Agathon&mdash;he
who delights to walk delicately upon the tender places of the
soul. Next we find him asleep upon his folded pinions, the mischievous
child who rewarded Anacreon's hospitality by wounding
him, and who gave to the thirsty heart of Meleager scalding tears
to drink. How, in the last place, are we to distinguish Love from
Harpocrates, the silent, with one finger on his lip?</p>

<p>Turn next to Hermes. When the herald of Olympus met Priam<span class="pagenum"><a name="iPage_12" id="iPage_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
midway between Troy-town and Achilles' tent, he was, says
Homer,</p>

<p>"like a young man, with budding beard, whose bloom is in the
prime of grace." This adolescent loveliness belongs throughout
to Hermes. As the genius of the gymnasium,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> he is a deified
athlete, scarcely to be distinguished from the quoit-throwers and
the runners he protects. The Hermes, who woos a nymph with
his arm around her waist,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> has Persuasion for his parent. Again,
the seated Hermes, with wings upon his ankles, is the swiftness of
auroral light incarnate.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Nor lastly, when, with chlamys thrown
upon his shoulder and petasos slung from his neck, he leads souls
to Hades, caduceus in hand, has he lost this quality of youth and
lustre.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> He upon Aphrodite begat Hermaphrodite. Their union&mdash;the
union of athletic goodliness and consummate womanhood&mdash;produced
a blending of two beauties forgotten by an oversight
of nature.</p>

<p>How various again is Bacchus, passing from the stately mildness
of the bearded Indian god to the wantonness of Phales, the
"night-wandering reveller!" At one time you can scarcely distinguish
him from young Apollo or young Herakles; at another
his brows and tresses have the chastity of Love; again he assumes
the voluptuous form which befits the sire by Aphrodite of
Priapus. The fascination of the grape-juice lends itself to all
qualities that charm the soul of man. Yet another of these cognate
deities may be mentioned. That is the Genius of Eternal
Slumber,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> reclining with arms folded above his head, upright
against a tree. To judge by his attitude, he might be Bacchus,
wine-drowsy, as in a statue of the gallery at Florence. Looking
at his long tresses, we call him Love: and what deities are of
closer kin than Love and Death? His stately form, not unlike
that of Ph&#339;bus, makes us exclaim in &AElig;schylean language, &#8038;
&#952;&#8049;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#8049;&#957; (O Death, the healer!). But he is stronger and
more enduring, less swift to move, less light of limb, than any of
these. It was a deep and touching intuition of the Greeks which
prompted them to ascribe these kinships to Death. Who knows
even now whether the winged and sworded genius of the Ephesus
column be Love or Death? To trace such analogies further
would be fanciful: it is enough to pluck at random a few blossoms,
and to scatter them for lovers. To Winckelmann and the
antiquaries may be left the accurate distinctions of the Greek deities.
Without seeking to confound these, but rather studying
them most carefully, we may yet discern by passing hints that
purity of tact which enabled the Greeks to interpret in their statuary
every <i>nuance</i> of feeling and of fancy, and to mark by subtlest
suggestions their points of agreement as well as of divergence.</p>

<p>When Hippolytus in Euripides first appears upon the scene, he
greets Artemis with these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady, for thee this garland have I woven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wilding flowers, plucked from an unshorn meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where neither shepherd dares to feed his flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever scythe hath swept, but through the grasses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unshorn in spring the bee pursues her labors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maiden modesty with running rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters the garden.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before the Meleager of the Vatican, so calm and strong and
redolent of forest odors, this orison rings in our memory, and the
Diana of the Louvre seems ready to spring forth and loose her
hind and call on the hero to hunt with her. The life of woods
and mountains was divined and interpreted with fine sensibility
by the Attic sculptors. Children of the earth, and conscious of
their own recent birth from the bosom of the divine in nature,
they loved all fair and fresh things of the open world fraternally.
Therefore they could carve the mystery of the Praxitelean Faun,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
whose subtle smile is a lure for souls, and the profound sleep of
the Barberini Faun,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> who seems to have but half escaped from
elemental existence, and still to own some kindred with unconscious
things. The joy of the shepherd who carries on his back
a laughing child at Naples; the linked arms of Bacchus and Ampelus;
the young Triton<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> who blows his horn over the crests of
the waves, and calls upon his brethren the billows to rejoice with
him, as he bears his nymph away; the subtle charm of double
life in Hermaphrodite, in whom two sexes are hidden, like a bitter
and a sweet almond in one beautiful but barren husk; the
frank sensuality of Silenus and Priapus; the dishevelled hair
and quivering flanks of M&aelig;nads; the laughter of Eros wreathed
around with coils of the enamoured dolphin's tail;<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> the pride of
the eagle soaring heavenward with Ganymede among his plumes:
from tokens like these, together with the scenes of the Bacch&aelig;
and the Cyclops of Euripides, the idyls of Theocritus, and the
dedicatory epigrams of the Anthology, we learn of what sort was
the sympathy of the Greeks for nature. Their beautiful humanity
is so close to the mother ever youthful of all life, to the full-breasted
earth, that they seem calling through their art to the
woods and waves and rivers, crying to their brethren that still
tarry: "Come forth, and be like us; begin to feel and know
your happiness; put on the form of flesh in which the world's
soul reaches consciousness!" Humanity defined upon the borderland
of nature is the life of all Greek sculpture. Even the
gods are films of fleshly form emergent on the surface of the elements.
The circle of the sun dilates, and Ph&#339;bus grows into distinctness
with the glory round him; out of the liquid ether gaze
the divine eyes of Zeus; Poseidon rises breast-high from the mirrors
of the sea. Man, for the first time conscious of his freedom,
yet clinging still to the breasts that gave him suck, like a flower
rooted to the kindly earth, expresses all his thought and feeling
in the language of his own shape. "The Greek spirit," says Hegel,
"is the plastic artist forming the stone into a work of art."
And this work of art is invariably the image of a man or woman.
The most sublime aspirations, the subtlest intuitions, the darkest
forebodings, the audacities of passion, the freedom of the senses,
put on personality in Hellas and assume a robe of carnal beauty.
In Egypt and the Orient humanity lay still upon "the knees of
a mild mystery." The Egyptians had not discovered the magic
word by means of which the world might be translated into the
language of mankind: their art still remained within the sphere
of symbolism which excludes true sympathy. The Jews had concentrated
their thought upon moral phenomena: in their jealousy
of the abstract purity of the soul they banned the arts as
impious.</p>

<p>Theognis tells us that when the Muses and the Graces came
down from Olympus to the marriage-feast of Cadmus and Harmonia,
they sang a song with this immortal burden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8005;&#964;&#964;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;, &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#903; &#964;&#8056; &#948;' &#959;&#8016; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957; &#959;&#8016; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This strikes the key-note to the music of the Greek genius. Beauty
is the true province of the Greeks, their indefeasible domain.
But their conception of beauty was both more comprehensive and
more concrete than any which a modern race, perturbed by the
division of the flesh and spirit, conscious of Jewish no less than
Greek tradition, can attain to. When Goethe expressed his theory
of life in the following couplet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Im Ganzen, Guten, Sch&ouml;nen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolut zu leben,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he supplied us with a correct definition of the spirit which governed
Hellas. Beauty to the Greeks was one aspect of the universal
synthesis, commensurate with all that is fair in manners
and comely in morals. It was the harmony of man with nature
in a well-balanced and complete humanity, the bloom of health
upon a conscious being, satisfied, as flowers and stars are satisfied,
with the conditions of temporal existence. It was the joy-note
of the whole world, heard and echoed by the sole being who could
comprehend it&mdash;man. That alone was beautiful which uttered a
sound in unison with the whole, and all was good which had this
quality of concord. To be really beautiful was to be an integral
part of the world's symphony, to be developed fully in all parts,
without an undue preference for the soul before the body or
for the passions before the reason&mdash;to maintain the rhythm and
the measure and the balance of those faculties which characterize
man, nature's masterpiece. The profounder reaches of this
thought were explored by philosophers, who figured the soul as
a harmony, who conceived of God as the Idea of Beauty, or who,
like Marcus Aurelius, defined virtue to be a living and enthusiastic
sympathy with nature. In the region of social life it led the
Greeks to treat the State as an organic whole, which might be
kept in preservation by the balance of its several forces. In the
sphere of religion it produced a race of gods, each perfect in his
individuality, distinct and self-contained, but blending, like the
colors of the prism, in the white light of Zeus, who was the
whole.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In actual life it facilitated the development of characters
which, by the free expansion of personality and by a conscious
culture, were themselves consummate works of art. Just
as the unity of the Greek religion was not the unity of the one,
but of the many, blent and harmonized in the variety that we observe
in nature, so the ideal of Greek life imposed no commonplace
conformity to one fixed standard on individuals, but each
man was encouraged to complete and realize the type of himself
to the utmost. Pericles devoted his energy to the perfecting of
statesmanship, and became the incarnation of the Athenian spirit;
Pindar was a poet through and through; for the Olympian victor
it was enough to be physically complete; Pheidias lived in
concord with the universe by his exclusive devotion to his art.
Thus formed and modelled to the utmost perfection each of his
own kind, these characters, when contemplated together from a
distance, like the deities of Olympus, present, in the harmony that
springs from difference, an ideal of humanity. The Greek no less
than the Christian might need to cut off his right hand&mdash;to debar
himself like Pericles from the pleasures of society, or to cast
aside the sin that doth so easily beset us, like Socrates, who trampled
under foot his sensual instincts&mdash;for the attainment of that
self-evolution which gave him the right to be one note in the
concord of the whole, one color in the prism of humanity. The
one thing needful to him was, not belief in the unseen, nor of necessity
holiness, but a firm resolve to comprehend and cultivate
his own capacity, and thus to add his quota to the sum of beauty
in the world.</p>

<p>The Greeks were essentially a nation of artists. Of the infinite
attributes of God, of the infinite qualities of the whole, they clearly
apprehended beauty. <i>That</i> they conceived largely and liberally,
not narrowly and partially, as we are wont to do. And, like
consummate craftsmen, they did thoroughly whatsoever in the
region of things plastic their hands found to do&mdash;so thoroughly
that men have only done the work again in so far as they have
followed the Greek rule. When we speak of the Greeks as an
&aelig;sthetic nation, this is what we mean. Guided by no supernatural
revelation, with no Mosaic law for conduct, they trusted their
&#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, delicately trained and preserved in a condition of the utmost
purity. This tact is the ultimate criterion in all matters of
art&mdash;a truth which we recognize in our use of the word &aelig;sthetic,
though we too often attempt to import the alien elements of metaphysical
dogmatism and moral prejudice into the sphere of beauty.
This tact was also for the Greeks the ultimate criterion of
ethics. &#8025;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8054; &#952;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#8183;, says Simonides.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> A
man in perfect health of mind and body, enjoying the balance of
mental, moral, and physical qualities which health implies, carried
within himself the norm and measure of propriety. Those
were the days when "love was an unerring light, and joy its own
security." What we call the conscience, our continual reference
to the standard of the divine will, scarcely existed for the Greek.
To that further stage in the education of the world, where moral
instincts are deepened and enforced by spiritual religion, he had
not advanced. But instead of it he had for a guide this true artistic
sensibility, developed by centuries of training, fortified by
traditional canons of good taste and prudence, and subject to
continual correction by reciprocal comparison and dialectical debate.
The lawgiver, the sculptor, the athlete, the statesman, the
philosopher, the poet, the warrior, the musician, each added
something of his own to the formation of a &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
or common taste, by which the individual might regulate his instincts.</p>

<p>To suppose that the Greeks were not a highly moralized race
is perhaps the strangest misconception to which religious prejudice
has ever given rise. If their morality was &aelig;sthetic and not
theocratic, it was none the less on that account humane and real.
The difficulty for the critic is to seize exactly that which is Hellenic&mdash;enduring
and common to the race, not transient and due
to individuals&mdash;in their religion and their ethics. In order to
appreciate the first fine flavor of the Greek intellect, it is necessary
to go back to Homer, who represents a period when the instincts
of the Hellenes had not been sophisticated by philosophical reflection
or vitiated by contact with Asiatic luxury. Homer joins
hands with Pheidias and Aristophanes and Sophocles in a chain
of truly Greek tradition. But side by side with them there runs
a deeper and more mystic strain. The blood-justice of the Eumenides,
the asceticism of Pythagoras, the purificatory rites of
Empedocles and Epimenides, the dreadful belief in a jealous God,
and the doctrine of hereditary guilt in Theognis, Herodotus, and
Solon, are fragments of primitive or Asiatic superstition unharmonized
with the serene element of the Hellenic spirit. At the
same time the orgiastic cult of Dionysus and the voluptuous worship
of the Corinthian Aphrodite are intrusions from without.
To eliminate such cruder moral and religious notions was the impulse
of the vigorous Greek mind. Yet at one critical moment
of history mysticism attained undue development and bid fair to
force the Hellenic genius into uncongenial regions. The Persian
war, by its lesson of a mortal peril escaped miraculously, quickened
the spiritual convictions of the race.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It was then that &AElig;schylus
conceived his tragic doctrine of Retribution, whereof the motto
is &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, and Pindar sounded with an awful sense
of mystery the possible abysses of a future life. Greece, after the
struggle with Xerxes, passed through a period of feverish exaltation,
in which her placid contemplation of the beauty of the world
was interrupted. She, whose vocation it was to see only by the
light of the serene and radiant sun, seemed on the verge of becoming
a clairvoyant. But the balance was soon righted. Even
in Pindar, moral mysticism is, as it were, encysted, like an alien
deposit, in the more vital substance of &aelig;sthetic conceptions.
Sophocles corrects the gloomy extravagance of &AElig;schylus. The
law of tragedy in Sophocles is no longer that the doer of a deed
must suffer, but that he who offends unwittingly will be accounted
innocent. Euripides shifts the ground of moral interest from
religious beliefs to sophistical analysis. Meanwhile Aristophanes,
the true Athenian conservative, is equally opposed to metaphysical
subtleties and to superstitious fancies; while Socrates directs
his polemic against sciolism in philosophy and childishness in
mythology, without thinking it worth while to attack the superstition
of the mystics. In Plato's ethics the highest altitude of
sane Greek speculation is attained; and here we see how much
akin, in all essential matters of morality, the intuition of the
Greeks was to the revealed doctrine of the Christians. Aristophanes
reflects the clearest image of Greek versatility and cheerfulness.
Pericles, freed by Anaxagoras from foolish fears, realizes the
genuine Greek life of steadfast, self-reliant activity. The drama of
Sophocles sets forth a complete view of human destiny as conceived
by the most perfect of Greek intellects. Antigone dares
to trust her own &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, her moral tact, in opposition to unnatural
law. &#338;dipus suffers no further than his own quality of
rashness justifies. When we arrive at Aristotle, who yields the
abstract of all that previously existed in the Greek mind, we see
that the scientific spirit has achieved a perfect triumph. His science
is the correlative in the region of pure thought to the art
which in sculpture had pursued an uninterrupted course of natural
evolution.</p>

<p>In the adolescent age of the Greek genius, mankind, not having
yet fully arrived at spiritual self-consciousness, was still as sinless
and simple as any other race that lives and dies upon the
globe, forming a part of the natural order of the world. The
sensual impulses, within reasonable limits, like the intellectual and
the moral, were then held void of crime and harmless. Health
and good taste controlled the physical appetites of man, just as
the appetites of animals are regulated by unerring instinct. In
the same way a standard of moderation determined moral virtue
and intellectual excellence. But in addition to this protective
check upon the passions, a noble sense of the beautiful, as that
which is balanced and restrained within limits, prevented the
Greeks of the best period from diverging into Asiatic extravagance
of pleasure. License was reckoned barbarous, and the barbarians
were slaves by nature, &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#953;: Hellenes, born to be
free men, took pride in temperance. Their &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, or self-restraint,
coextensive as a protective virtue with the whole of their
&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8057;&#957;, or ideal of form, was essentially Greek&mdash;the quality beloved
by Ph&#339;bus, in whom was no dark place nor any flaw. With
the Romans, humanity, not having yet transcended the merely
natural order, remaining unconscious of a higher religious ideal,
and at the same time uncontrolled by exquisite Greek sense of fitness,
began to wax wanton. To the state of paradisal innocence
succeeded the fall. The bestial side of our mixed nature encroached
upon the spiritual, and the sense of beauty was perturbed
by lust. That true health, without which the unassisted tact is a
false guide, failed; no fine law of taste corrected appetite. It was
at this moment that Christianity convicted mankind of sin. The
voice of God was heard crying in the garden. The unity of man
with nature was abruptly broken. Flesh and spirit were defined
and counterpoised. Man, abiding far from God in his flesh,
sought after God in his spirit. His union with God was no longer
an actual state of mundane innocence, but a distant, future, dim,
celestial possibility, to be achieved by the sacrifice of this fair life
of earth. "Your lives are hid with Christ in God." Together
with this separation of the flesh and spirit wrought by Christianity,
came the abhorrence of beauty as a snare, the sense that carnal
affections were tainted with sin, the unwilling toleration of
sexual love as a necessity, the idealization of celibacy and solitude.
At the same time humanity acquired new faculties and wider sensibilities,
those varied powers which make the modern man more
complex and more mighty both for good and evil than the ancient.
A profounder and more vital feeling of the mysteries of the
universe arose. Our life on earth was seen to be a thing by no
means rounded in itself and perfect, but only one term of an infinite
and unknown series. It was henceforward impossible to
translate the world into the language of purely &aelig;sthetic form.
This stirring of the spirit marks the transition of the ancient to
the modern world.</p>

<p>At the time of the Renaissance the travail was well-nigh over;
the lesson had been learned and exaggerated; mankind began to
resent the one-sidedness of monastic Christianity, and to yearn
once more for the fruit and flowers of the garden which was
Greece. Yet the spirit and the flesh still remained in unreconciled
antagonism. Over the gate of Eden the arm of the seraph
waved his terrible sword. But humanity in rebellion, while outcast
from God and convicted of sin, would not refrain from plucking
the pleasure of the sense. This was the time of the insolence
of the flesh, when antichrist sat in St. Peter's chair, and
when man, knowing his nakedness, submitted to the fascinations
of the siren, Shame. The old health of the Greeks, their simple
and unerring tact, was gone: to recover that was impossible.
Christ crowned with thorns, the Sabbaths and ablutions of the
Jews, the "thunderous vision" of St. Paul, had intervened and fixed
a gulf between Hellas and modern Europe. In that age the
love of beauty became a tragic disease like the plague which Aphrodite
sent in wrath on Ph&aelig;dra. Even Michael Angelo, at the
end of a long life spent in the service of the noblest art, felt constrained
to write:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now hath my life across a stormy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a frail bark, reached that wide port where all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are bidden ere the final judgment fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of good and evil deeds to pay the fee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now know I well how that fond fantasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which made my soul the worshipper and thrall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of earthly art, is vain; how criminal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is that which all men seek unwillingly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those amorous thoughts which were so lightly dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What are they when the double death is nigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The one I know for sure, the other dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painting nor sculpture now can lull to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My soul, that turns to his great love on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose arms to clasp us on the cross were spread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his work sculpture is forced to express what lies beyond its
province&mdash;the throes and labor of the spirit. Michael Angelo was
not a plastic character in the sense in which Hegel used this
phrase. His art reflects the combat of his nature and his age;
whence comes what people call its extravagance and emphasis.
Raphael from the opposite side introduced pagan form and feeling
into his purely religious work of art; whence came what people
call his decadence. Puritan England, inquisition-ridden Spain,
and critical Germany offer still more permanent signs of this deep-seated
division in the modern world between the natural instincts
and the spiritual aspirations of humanity. Even to the present
day this division distorts our sense of beauty and prevents our
realizing an ideal of art.</p>

<p>After all, the separation between the Greeks and us is due to
something outside us rather than within&mdash;principally to the Hebraistic
culture we receive in childhood. We are taught to think
that one form of religion contains the whole truth, and that one
way of feeling is right, to the exclusion of the humanities and
sympathies of races no less beloved of God and no less kindred to
ourselves than were the Jews. At the same time, the literature
of the Greeks has for the last three centuries formed the basis of
our education; their thoughts and sentiments, enclosed like precious
perfumes in sealed vases, spread themselves abroad and steep
the soul in honey-sweet aromas. Some will always be found, under
the conditions of this double culture, to whom Greece is a lost
fatherland, and who, passing through youth with the <i>mal du pays</i>
of that irrecoverable land upon them, may be compared to visionaries,
spending the nights in golden dreams and the days in common
duties.</p>

<p>Has, then, the modern man no method for making the Hellenic
tradition vital instead of dream-like&mdash;invigorating instead of enervating?
There is, indeed, this one way only&mdash;to be natural.
We must imitate the Greeks, not by trying to reproduce their bygone
modes of life and feeling, but by approximating to their free
and fearless attitude of mind. While frankly recognizing that
much of their liberty would for us be license, and that the moral
progress of the race depends on holding with a firm grasp what
the Greeks had hardly apprehended, we ought still to emulate
their spirit by cheerfully accepting the world as we find it, acknowledging
the value of each human impulse, and aiming after
virtues that depend on self-regulation rather than on total abstinence
and mortification. To do this in the midst of our conventionalities
and prejudices, our interminglement of unproved expectations
and unrefuted terrors, is no doubt hard. Yet if we fail
of this, we miss the best the Greeks can teach us. Nor need we
fear lest, in the attempt, we should lose what Christianity has
given us. Those who believe sincerely in the divine life of the
world, who recognize the truth that there can be nothing vitally
irreconcilable between the revelations made to the great races
that have formed our past, will dismiss such fears with a smile.
It was not against the spirit of the Greeks that St. Paul preached,
but against the vices of a decadent society in Hellas. It is not
against the spirit of Christianity that modern reformers lift their
voices, but against the corruption and exaggeration of its precepts
in monasticism and Puritanism. The problem of the present and
the future is to bring both spirits into due accord, to profit by
both revelations while avoiding their distortion and abuse.</p>

<p>In the struggle of the adverse forces, felt so strongly ever since
the reactionary age of the Renaissance, there is, however, now at
least a hope of future reconciliation. The motto</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Im Ganzen, Guten, Sch&ouml;nen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolut zu leben,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is not a strictly Christian sentence. St. Paul had said: "To me
to live is Christ, and to die is gain." But it is essentially human.
The man who lives by it is restored to that place in the world
which he has a right to occupy, instead of regarding himself as
an alien and an outcast from imagined heaven. Science must be
our redeemer. Science which teaches man to know himself, and
explains to him his real relation to nature. The healthy acceptance
of the physical laws to which we are subordinated need not
prevent our full consciousness of moral law. It is true that the
beautiful Greek life, as of leopards and tiger-lilies and eagles, cannot
be restored. Yet neither need we cling to the convent or the
prison life of early Catholicity. The new freedom of man must
consist of submission to the order of the universe as it exists.
The final discovery that there is no antagonism between our physical
and spiritual constitution, but rather a most intimate connection,
must place the men of the future upon a higher level and
a firmer standing-ground than the Greeks. They by experience
and demonstration will know what the Greeks felt instinctively.
Their &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, permeated and strengthened by the ever-during
influence of Christianity, will be further fortified by the recognition
of immutable law. The tact of healthy youth will be succeeded
by the calm reason of maturity.</p>

A childish fear of the divine government pervaded the Greeks of the age of
Herodotus. This by the dramatists was exalted to a conception of the holy
and the jealous God. But the good sense of the Greeks led the philosophers
to eliminate from their theory of the world even the sublime theosophy of
&AElig;schylus. The soul of man, as analyzed by Plato in the <i>Republic</i>, has only
to suffer from the inevitable consequences of its own passions. Plato theorizes
the humanity implicit in Homer.</p></div></div>

<p>I may, perhaps, be allowed in this last chapter to quit the
impersonal style of the essayist and to refer to some strictures
passed upon earlier chapters of these studies. Critics for whose
opinion I feel respect have observed that, in what I wrote about
the genius of Greek art, I neglected to notice the sterner and
more serious qualities of the Greek spirit, that I exaggerated the
importance of sculpture as the characteristic Hellenic art, and
that I did not make my meaning clear about the value of the
study of Greek modes of thought and feeling for men living in
our scientific age. To take up these topics in detail, and to
answer some of these indictments, is my purpose in the present
chapter. They are so varied that I may fairly be excused for
adopting a less methodical and connected development of ideas
than ought to be demanded from a man who is not answering
objections, but preferring opinions.</p>

<p>To take the least important of these questions first: why is
sculpture selected as the most eminent and characteristic art of
the Hellenic race, when so much remains of their poetry and of
prose work in the highest sense artistic? To my mind the answer
is simple enough. One modern nation has produced a drama
which can compete with that of Athens. Another has carried
painting to a perfection we have little reason to believe it ever
reached in Greece. A third has satisfied the deepest and the
widest needs of our emotional nature by such music as no Greek,
in all probability, had any opportunity of hearing. In the last
place, Gothic architecture, the common heritage of all the European
nations of the modern world, is at least as noble as the architecture
of the ancients. The Greeks alone have been unique in
sculpture: what survives of Pheidias and Praxiteles, of Polycletus
and Scopas, and of their schools, transcends in beauty and in power,
in freedom of handling and in purity of form, the very highest
work of Donatello, Della Quercia, and Michael Angelo. We have,
therefore, a <i>prima facie</i> right to lay great stress on sculpture as a
Greek art, just as we have the <i>prima facie</i> right to select painting
as an Italian art. The first step taken from this position leads to
the reflection that, within the sphere of art at any rate, the one
art which a nation has developed as its own, to which it has succeeded
in giving unique perfection, and upon which it has impressed
the mark of its peculiar character, will lend the key for
the interpretation of its whole &aelig;sthetic temperament. The Italians
cannot have been singularly and pre-eminently successful in
painting without displaying some of the painter's qualities in all
their artistic products. The Greeks cannot have made sculpture
unapproachably complete without possessing a genius wherein the
sculptor's bent of mind was specially predominant, and thus infusing
somewhat of the sculpturesque into the sister arts. Painting
for Italy and sculpture for Greece may be fairly taken as the
fully formed and flawless crystals in a matrix of congenial, but not
equally developed, matter. The ideal to which either race aspired
instinctively in all its art was realized to the fullest, by the one in
sculpture, by the other in painting. So we are justified in testing
the whole of their &aelig;sthetic products by the laws of painting and
of sculpture respectively. This, broadly stated, without economy
of phrase or cautious reservation, is the reason why a student who
has tried, however imperfectly, to assimilate to himself the spirit
displayed in the surviving monuments of Greek art, is brought back
at every turn to sculpture as the norm and canon of them all.</p>

<p>Whatever knowledge he may gain about the circumstances of
Greek life and the peculiar temper of Greek thought will only
strengthen his conviction. The national games, the religious pageants,
the theatrical shows, and the gymnastic exercises of the
Greeks were sculpturesque. The conditions of their speculative
thought in the first dawn of civilized self-consciousness, when
spiritual energy was still conceived as incarnate only in a form of
flesh, and the soul was inseparable from the body except by an
unfamiliar process of analysis, harmonized with the art which interprets
the mind in all its movements by the features and the
limbs. Their careful choice of distinct motives in poetry, their
appeal in all imaginative work to the inner eye that sees, no less
than to the sympathies that thrill, their abstinence from descriptions
of landscape and analyses of emotion, their clear and massive
character-delineation, point to the same conclusion. Everything
tends to confirm the original perception that the simplicity
of form, the purity of design, the self-restraint, and the parsimony
both of expression and material, imposed by sculpture on the artist,
were observed as laws by the Greeks in their mental activity,
and more especially in their arts. It is this which differentiates
them from the romantic nations. When, therefore, we undertake
to speak of the genius of Greek art, we are justified in giving the
first place to sculpture and in assuming that sculpture strikes the
key-note of the whole music.</p>

<p>To take a far more serious objection next. It is true that,
while gazing intently upon the luminous qualities of the Greek
spirit, we are tempted to neglect its sterner and more sombre
aspect. Not, indeed, that the shadows are not there, patent to
superficial observers, and necessary even to the sublimity of the
ideal we admire in its serene beauty; but they are so consistently
subordinated to light and lustre that he who merely seeks to seize
predominant characteristics may find it difficult to appreciate them
duly without missing what is even more essential. A writer on
the arts of the Greeks is not bound to take into consideration the
defects of their civil and domestic life, the discords and disturbance
of their politics, the pains they felt and suffered in common
with humanity at large, the incomplete morality of a race defined
by no sharp line but that of culture from barbarians. It is rather
his duty to note how carefully these things, which even we discern
as discords, were excluded by them from the sphere of beauty;
since it is precisely this that distinguishes the Greeks most decidedly
from the modern nations, who have used pain, perplexity,
and apparent failure as subjects for the noblest &aelig;sthetic handling.
The world-pain of our latter years was felt, as a young man may
feel it, by the Greeks of the best age; but their artists did not,
like Shakespeare and Michael Angelo, Goethe and Beethoven,
make this the substance of their mightiest works. Ancient Hellas
contained nothing analogous to Hamlet, or the tombs of the
Medici to Faust or the C minor symphony. The desolation of
humanity adrift upon a sea of chance and change finds expression
here and there in a threnos of Simonides or an epigram of Callimachus.
The tragic poets are never tired of dwelling upon destiny,
inherent partly in the transmitted doom of ancestors, and
partly in the moral character of individuals. The depth of
Pindar's soul is stirred by the question that has tried all ages:
"Creatures of a day! What are we and what are we not?"
Such strains, however, are, as it were, occasional and accidental
in Greek poetry. The Greek artist, not having a background of
Christian hope and expectation against which he could relieve
the trials and afflictions of this life, aimed at keeping them in a
strictly subordinate place. He sought to produce a harmony in
his work which should correspond to health in the body and to
temperance in the soul, to present a picture of human destiny,
not darkened by the shadows of the tomb, but luminous beneath
the light of day. It was his purpose, as indeed it is of all good
craftsmen, not to weaken, but to fortify, not to dispirit and depress,
but to exalt and animate. The very imperfect conceptions
he had formed of immortality determined the course he pursued.
He had no hell to fear, no heaven to hope for. It was in no sense
his duty to cast a gloom over the only world he knew by painting
it in sombre colors, but rather to assist the freedom of the
spirit, and to confirm the energies of men by bringing what is
glad and beautiful into prominence. In this way, the Greeks,
after their own fashion, asserted that unconquerable faith in the
goodness of the universe, and in the dignity of the human race,
without which progress would be impossible. Though the life
of man may be hard and troublous, though diseases and turbulent
passions assail his peace, though the history of nations be but a
tale that is told, and the days of heroes but a dream between two
sleeps, yet the soul is strong to rise above these vapors of the
earth into a clearer atmosphere. The real way of achieving a triumph
over chance and of defying fate is to turn to good account
all fair and wholesome things beneath the sun, and to maintain
for an ideal the beauty, strength, and splendor of the body, mind,
and will of man. The mighty may win fame, immortal on the
lips of poets and in the marble of the sculptor. The meanest
may possess themselves in patience and enjoy. Thus the Greeks
adopted for their philosophy of life what Clough described as a
"Stoic-Epicurean acceptance" of the world. They practised a
genial accommodation of their natures to the facts which must
perforce regulate the existence of humanity. To ascertain the
conditions of nature, and to adapt themselves thereto by training,
was the object of their most serious schemes of education. Later
on, when the bloom began to pass from poetry and art, and the
vigor of national life declined, this attitude of simple manliness
diverged into hedonism and asceticism. Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die, said one section of the thinkers. Let us bear
all hardness, lest we become the slaves of chance and self, said the
other. But neither proposition expressed the full mind of the
Greeks of the best age. They clearly saw that, in spite of disaster
and disease, life was a good thing for those who maintained
the balance of moral and physical health. Without asceticism
they strove after well-ordered conduct. Without hedonism they
took their frugal share of the delightful things furnished by the
boon earth in prodigal abundance. The mental condition of such
men, expectant, grateful, and serenely acquiescent, has been well
expressed by Goethe in lines like these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That naught belongs to me I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save thoughts that never cease to flow<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From founts that cannot perish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every fleeting shape of bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kindly fortune lets me kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And in my bosom cherish.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is this mental attitude which I think must be regained by us
who seek firm foothold in the far more complicated difficulties of
the present age. While it is easy, therefore, to omit the darker
shadows from our picture of Greek life, because, although they
are there, they are almost swallowed up in brightness, it is not
easy to exaggerate the tranquil and manly spirit with which the
Greeks faced the evils of the world and rose above them. Owing
to this faculty for absorbing all sad things and presenting, through
art, only the splendor of accomplished strength and beauty, the
Greeks have left for the world a unique treasure of radiant forms
in sculpture, of lustrous thoughts in poetry, of calm wisdom in
philosophy and history. Their power upon all arts and sciences is
the power of a harmonizing and health-giving spirit. This it is
which, in spite of their perception of the sterner problems of the
world, obliges us to describe their genius as adolescent; for adolescence
has of strength and sorrow and reflection so much only
as is compatible with beauty. This, again, it is which makes their
influence so valuable to us now, who need for our refreshening the
contact with unused and youthful forces.</p>

<p>At the same time, while insisting upon the truth of all this,
many of the chapters in my two volumes have forced upon our
minds what is severe and awful in the genius of the Greeks. The
Chthonian deities form a counterpart to the dwellers on Olympus.
The voice of the people in the Hesiodic poems rises like the cry
of Israel from Pharaoh's brickfields rather than the song-like
shout of Salaminian oarsmen. Who, again, in reading the <i>Iliad</i>,
has not felt that the glory of Achilles, coruscating like a star new-washed
in ocean waves, detaches itself from a background of impenetrable
gloom? He blazes in his godlike youth for one moment
only above the mists of Styx, the waters of Lethe; and it is
due to the triumphant imagination of his poet that the consciousness
of impending fate adds lustre to his heroism instead of dooming
him to the pathetic pallor of the Scandinavian Balder. When
we meet Achilles in Hades, and hear him sigh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rather would I in the sun's warmth divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serve a poor churl who drags his days in grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the whole lordship of the dead were mine,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we touch the deepest sorrow of the Greek heart, a sorrow lulled
to rest in vain by anodynes of Eleusinian mysteries and Samotracian
rites, a sorrow kept manfully in check by resolute wills
and burning enthusiasms, but which recurred continually, converting
their dream of a future life into a nightmare of unsubstantial
ennui. If the story of Achilles involves a dreary insight into the
end of merely human activity, that of Odysseus turns immediately
upon the troubles of our pilgrimage through life. Exquisitely
beautiful as are all the outlines, surface touches, and colors in the
<i>Odyssey</i>, as of some Mediterranean landscape crowded with delicate
human forms, yet beneath the whole there lies an undertone
of sombreness. The energy of the hero is inseparable from endurance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#964;&#8051;&#964;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#953; &#948;&#8052; &#954;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#8055;&#951;&#903; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#8059;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#960;&#959;&#964;' &#7956;&#964;&#955;&#951;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is the exclamation of no light-hearted youngling, but of one
who has sounded all the deeps and shallows of the river of experience.
And if we have to speak thus of the heroes, what shall
we say about the countless common people following their lords
to Troy in the cause of a strange woman, those beautiful dead
warriors over whom the &AElig;schylean chorus poured forth the most
pathetic of lamentations? To pretend that the Greeks felt not
the passion and the pain of human agony and strife would be a
paradox implying idiocy in him who put it forth. Still, it were
scarcely less feeble to forget that their strength lay in restraining
the expression of this feeling and in subduing its vehemence.
The wounded heroes on the &AElig;ginetan pediment are dying with
smiles upon their lips; and this may serve as a symbol for the
mode of treatment reserved by the Greek artists for what is dark
and terrible.</p>

<p>Enough has been already said while dealing with the dramatists
about the profound morality and the stern philosophy of the
Greek tragic poets. It is not necessary again to traverse that
ground. Yet for a moment we may once more remember here
what depths of pity and of pathos lie hidden in the legend of
Prometheus, whether we think of him as the divine champion of
erring men at war with envious deities, or as personified humanity
struggling against the forces of niggardly nature. Prometheus
and Epimetheus and Pandora dramatize a legend of life supremely
sad&mdash;so sad, indeed, that the calm genius of the Greeks regarded
it with half-averted eyes, and chose rather to blur its outlines than
to define what it contained&mdash;enough of sorrow to unman the stoutest.
Poets of a Northern race would have brooded over this mythus
until it became for them the form of all the anguish and revolt
and aspiration of the soul of man. Not so the Greeks. Hesiod
leaves the Saga in obscurity. &AElig;schylus employs it to exhibit
the spirit unperturbed by menaces of mere brute force, and
wisely pliant in the end to unavoidable fate. Subsequent poets
and philosophers remember Prometheus together with Orpheus
only as the founders of the arts and sciences that make men happy.
To eliminate the mysterious and the terrible, to accentuate
the joyous and the profitable for humane uses, was the truest instinct
of the Greeks. Even the tale of Herakles, who chose the
hard paths of life, and ascended at last only through flames to
clasp Hebe, eternal youth, upon Olympus, "with joy and bliss in
over-measure forever," in spite of its severe lesson of morality, is
a poem of beautiful human heroism from which the discordant
elements are purged away.</p>

<p>To recover, if that be possible, this "Stoic-Epicurean acceptance,"
and to face the problems of the world in which we live
with Greek serenity, concerns us at the present time. Having
said thus much, I am brought to touch upon the third topic mentioned
at the outset of this chapter. Owing to insufficient exposition,
I did not in my first series of <i>Studies of Greek Poets</i>, as originally
published, make it clear in what way I thought the Greeks
could teach those of us for whom the growth of rationalism and
the discoveries of science have tended to remove old landmarks.
What we have to win for ourselves is a theory of conduct which
shall be human, and which shall be based upon our knowledge of
nature. Greek morality was distinguished by precisely these two
qualities. In its best forms, moreover, it was not antagonistic to
the essence of Christianity, but thoroughly in accord with that
which is indestructible in Christian teaching. It therefore contained
that vital element we now require.</p>

<p>A remarkable passage in Sir H. S. Maine's Rede Lecture for
1875 will force itself upon the attention of all who believe that
there are still lessons to be learned from the Greeks by men of
the nineteenth century. "Whatever may be the nature and value
of that bundle of influences which we call progress," he writes,
"nothing can be more certain than that, when a society is once
touched by it, it spreads like a contagion. Yet, so far as our
knowledge extends, there was only one society in which it was
endemic; and putting that aside, no race or nationality, left entirely
to itself, appears to have developed any very great intellectual
result, except, perhaps, poetry. Not one of those intellectual
excellences which we regard as characteristic of the great
progressive races of the world&mdash;not the law of the Romans, not
the philosophy and sagacity of the Germans, not the luminous
order of the French, not the political aptitude of the English,
not that insight into physical nature to which all races have contributed&mdash;would
apparently have come into existence if those
races had been left to themselves. To one small people, covering
in its original seat no more than a hand's-breadth of territory, it
was given to create the principle of progress, of movement onward
and not backward or downward, of destruction tending
to construction. That people was the Greek. Except the blind
forces of nature, nothing moves in this world which is not Greek
in its origin. A ferment spreading from that source has vitalized
all the great progressive races of mankind, penetrating from one
to another, and producing results accordant with its hidden and
latent genius, and results of course often far greater than any exhibited
in Greece itself."</p>

<p>It may be difficult to form an accurate notion of what the eloquent
lecturer meant by progress: it may be easy to object that
the secret of progressive growth in politics, at least, was not possessed
by the Greeks themselves, and that Christianity, which has
certainly moved in this world far more efficiently than any other
spiritual force whatever, was as certainly neither one of the blind
forces of nature, nor yet Hellenic in its origin. Still, there is a
truth in this passage which remains unimpaired. It expresses
largely, and without due reservation, perhaps, what the students
of the Greeks in relation to the universal history of civilization
must feel to be a sweeping truth. The advance of the human intellect
is measured by successive points of contact with the Greek
spirit&mdash;in Rome before the birth of Christ, in Islam during the
exhaustion of the Roman Empire, in the schools of Paris and Seville
during the Middle Ages, when Averroes and Aristotle kept
alive the lamp of science, in Italy at the period of the Renaissance,
when Greek philosophy and poetry and art restored life to the
senses, confidence to the reason, and freedom to the soul of man.
All civilized nations, in all that concerns the activity of the intellect,
are colonies of Hellas. The flame that lives within our Prytaneia
was first kindled on Athene's hearth in Attica; and should
it burn dim or be extinguished, we must needs travel back to the
sacred home of the virgin goddess for fresh fire. This we are
continually doing. It is this which has made Greek indispensable
in modern education. And at the present moment we may
return with profit to the moralists of Greece.</p>

<p>At this point I feel that my former critics will exclaim against
me: "This is the very same offence repeated&mdash;ignoring the moral
inferiority of the Greeks, he holds them up as an example to
nations improved by Christianity." I reply that I am far from
forgetting the substantial advance made by the world in morality
during the last eighteen centuries. The divine life and the precepts
of Christ are as luminous as ever; and I, for one, have no
desire to replant pseudo-paganism on the modern soil. I know
full well that, in addition to its being undesirable, this is utterly
impossible. I know, moreover, that new virtues, unrecognized by
the Greeks, have been revealed to the world by Christianity, and
that a new cogency and new sanctions have been given by it to
that portion of ethics which it had in common with Greek philosophy.
It is not the morality, but the moral attitude, of the
Greeks that seems to my mind worthy of our imitation. In order
to make this distinction clear, and to save myself, if that may be,
from seeming to advocate a retrograde movement, through sentimental
sympathy with impossible anachronisms, or through blind
hostility to all that makes our modern life most beautiful, I must
be permitted to embark upon a somewhat lengthy exposition of
my meaning. With no desire to be aggressive or polemical, I
want to show what, in my judgment, even Christians have still to
learn from Greeks.</p>

<p>The three points in which the morality of the Greeks was decidedly
inferior to that of the modern races were slavery, the social
degradation of women, and paiderastia. No panegyrist of
the Greeks can attempt to justify any one of these customs, which,
it may be said in passing, were closely connected and interdependent
in Hellenic civilization. An apologist might, indeed,
argue that slavery, as recognized by the Athenians, was superior
to many forms of the same evil till lately tolerated by the Christian
nations. Medi&aelig;val villeinage and Russian serfdom, the Spanish
enslavement of Peruvians and Mexicans, and the American
slave-trade flourished in spite of the theoretical opposition of
Christianity, and have only succumbed to the advance of rational
humanity. The same advocate could show, as Mr. Mahaffy has
already done, that in Greece there existed a high ideal of womanhood.
All students of history will, however, admit that in relation
to the three important points above mentioned the Greeks
were comparatively barbarous. At the same time it cannot be
contended that these defects were the necessary and immediate
outcome of the Hellenic philosophy of life. It is rather proper
to regard them as crudities and immaturities belonging to an early
period of civilization. During the last two thousand years the
world has advanced in growth, and its moral improvement has
been due to Christian influences. Still the higher standing-ground
we have attained, our matured and purified humanity, all
that elevates us ethically above the Jews and Greeks, can be ascribed
to Christianity without the implication that it is inextricably
bound up with Christian theology, or that it could not survive
the dissolution of the orthodox fabric. The question before us
at the present moment is whether, admitting the comparatively
rude ethics of the ancient Greeks and fully recognizing the moral
amelioration effected for the human race by Christianity, we,
without ceasing to be Christians in all essential points of conduct,
may not profitably borrow from the Greeks the spirit which
enabled them to live and do their duty in a world whose laws as
yet are but imperfectly ascertained. Was there not something
permanently valuable in their view of the ethical problem which
historical Christianity, especially in its more ascetic phases, tends
to overlook, but which approves itself to the reason of men who
have been influenced by the rapidly advancing mutations of religious
thought during the last three centuries? The real point
to ascertain, with regard to ourselves and to them, is the basis
upon which the conceptions of morality in either period have
rested. Modern morality has hitherto been theological: it has
implied the will of a divine governor. Greek morality was radically
scientific: the faith on which it eventually leaned was a belief
in &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;, in the order of the universe, wherein gods, human
societies, and individual human beings had their proper places.
The conception of morality as the law for man, regarded as a social
being forming part and parcel of the Cosmos, was implicit in
the whole Greek view of life. It received poetical expression
from the tragedians; it transpired in the conversations of Socrates,
in the speculations of Plato, and in the more organized system
of Aristotle. &#950;&#8134;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#957; could be written for a motto on
the title-page of a collected corpus of Greek moralists. It may
be objected that "to live according to nature" is a vague command,
and also that it is easier said than done, or, again, that the
conception of nature does not essentially differ from that of God
who made nature. All that is true; but the ethics whereof that
maxim is the sum have this advantage, that they do not place between
us and the world in which we have to live and die the will
of a hypothetical ruler, to whom we may ascribe our passions and
our fancies, enslaving ourselves to the delusions of our own soul.
Nor, again, do they involve that monstrous paradox of all ascetic
systems, that human nature is radically evil and that only that is
good in us which contradicts our natural appetites and instincts.
Evil and sin are recognized, just as fevers and serpents are recognized;
but while the latter are not referred to a vindictive Creator,
so the former are not ascribed to the wilful wickedness of
his creatures. In so far as we gain any knowledge of nature, that
knowledge is something solid: the whole bearing of a man who
feels that his highest duty consists in conforming himself to laws
he may gradually but surely ascertain, is certainly different from
that of one who obeys the formulas invented by dead or living
priests and prophets to describe the nature of a God whom no
man has either seen or heard. It makes no difference that the
highest religious systems are concordant with the best-established
principles of natural science, that the Mosaic ordinances, for example,
are based on excellent hygienic rules. That the &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;
of the great Nomothet&aelig; should be verified is both intelligible
and, <i>a priori</i>, highly probable. The superiority of scientific over
theological morality consists meanwhile in its indestructibility.</p>

<p>The ethics of man regarded as a member of the universe, and
answerable only to its order for his conduct, though they underlay
the whole thought of the Greeks on moral subjects, did not
receive their final exposition till the age of the Roman Stoics.
The <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius have, therefore, a peculiar
retrospective value, owing to the light they cast upon the ethical
perception of the Greek race, while at the same time they illustrate
that which is unalterable and indestructible in the spirit of
Greek morality. What Marcus Aurelius enunciated as an intuition
is what must daily become more binding upon us in proportion
as we advance in scientific knowledge. It will not, therefore,
be out of place to sketch the main points of his system in a separate
paragraph, keeping always in mind that this system was the
final outgrowth of Greek speculation after prolonged contact with
the Romans. Marcus Aurelius forces to the very utmost a view
of human life and duty which could have been but unconsciously
implicit in the minds of men of the Periclean age. Yet this view
was but the theory logically abstracted from the conduct and the
perceptions of a race which started with refined nature-worship,
which recognized the duty to the State as paramount, and which
put to philosophy the question, What is the end of man?</p>

<p>The central notion of Marcus Aurelius is nature. He regards
the universe as a &#950;&#8182;&#959;&#957;, or living creature, animated by a principle
of life to which he sometimes gives the title of &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;, or the deity.
It is a body with a &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;, or reason, attaining to consciousness in
human beings. Every man participates in the &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;, or
common reason of the Cosmos, a portion of whose wisdom forms
his intellect. In other words, our consciousness reflects the order
of the universe, and enables us to become more than automatically
partakers in its movement. To obey this reason is the end of
all philosophy, the fulfilment of the purpose for which man exists.
By doing so we are in harmony with the world, and take our
proper place in the scale of beings. Nothing can happen to us
independent of this order; and therefore nothing, rightly understood,
can happen to our hurt. If disease and affliction fall upon
us, we must remember that we are the limbs and organs of the
whole, and that our suffering is necessary for its well-being. We
are thus the citizens of a vast state, members of the universal
economy. What affects the whole for good is good for us, and
even when it seems to be evil, we must hold fast to the faith that
it is good beyond our ken. Our selfishness is swallowed up in
the complete and total interest. Our virtues are social and not
personal. Our happiness is relative to the general welfare, not
contained in any private pleasure or indulgence of an individual
caprice.</p>

<p>The motto of this large philosophy is Goethe's often-quoted
distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Im Ganzen, Guten, Sch&ouml;nen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolut zu leben.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we seek a motto for the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, which may be accepted
here as the Christian encheiridion, we find it in the text,
"For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." The author of
that manual of conduct regarded the universe not as a coherent
whole, good and sound in all its parts, to live in harmony with the
laws whereof is the duty of man, but as a machine created out of
nothing by the will of God, made fair at first, but changed to foul
by sin, wherein men live an evil life, to escape from which brings
happiness, to confound the existing laws of which is virtue, and a
remedy against the anarchy and tyranny of which can only be
found in the cross and death of Christ. To the Stoicism of Marcus
Aurelius, man was not merely a citizen of the dear city of
God, but a member, not merely a &#956;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#962;, but a &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#959;&#962;, of the divine
life of the universe. To the Christianity of the <i>Imitatio</i>, man
was an exile from his home, a wanderer and out of place. It is
not my present purpose to push to their ultimate and logical conclusions
the divergences between the Stoicism of the <i>Meditations</i>
and the Christianity of the <i>Imitatio</i>, but rather to recall attention
to the philosophy developed by Marcus Aurelius from his conception
of man's place in nature, and to show that the ethics resulting
from it are specially adapted to an age in which the scientific
habit of mind is the strongest. When the whole mass of new
knowledge we are continually accumulating forces upon our consciousness
the conviction that humanity is a part of the universal
whole, it is impossible to cling to dogmas that start from the assumption
of original sin and creation vitiated at the very moment
of its commencement. So much of the Christian programme,
whatever else is left as indestructible, must be abandoned. Nature,
with all its imperfections in the physical and moral orders,
both of them to be as far as can be conquered and eradicated,
must be accepted as it is, as that which was intended so to be.
Nor need we adopt the obsolete tactics of the French deists, or
depreciate the essence of Christianity, because a great part of its
mythology and metaphysics seems untenable. On the contrary,
we may reasonably hold that the most perfect man would live the
life of Christ in obedience to the maxims of the Roman emperor,
and that Christianity provides us with precisely what was wanting
in the Aurelian system. Faith, love, purity, obedience, humility,
subordination of self, benevolence&mdash;all these are Christian virtues,
raised to the height of passionate enthusiasm by their exemplification
in the life of Christ. Stoicism stood in need of a criterion.
What is reason? what is the true character of truth and
goodness? Christianity appears with a criterion which approves
itself to our intuitive apprehension. The life of Christ is the perfect
life. Learn that, and follow that, and you will reach the
height of human nature. To live in harmony with the universe
is to live as Christ lived. It is the wrong done in the name of
Christ, the figments falsely stamped with Christ's superscription,
the follies of Bibliolatry and dogmatic orthodoxy, that must be
abjured; and I maintain that in our present mood the best hope
of not casting away the wheat together with the chaff, of retaining
what is fit for human use in Christianity, consists in first assuming
the scientific standpoint of Aurelius.</p>

<p>From this digression on the Aurelian system, regarded as the
final word of Gr&aelig;co-Roman morality, I pass to a consideration of
those urgent needs of modern thought which have to be met in
the spirit and with the courage of Mark Antonine. Not his theism,
nor his metaphysic, nor his detailed maxims for conduct, but
his attitude and temper have to be adopted. And here it must
be said once more, by way of preface, that however human progress
is ruled by thesis and antithesis, by antagonism and repulsion
in its several moments, still nothing can be lost that has been
clearly gained. Each synthesis, though itself destined to apparent
contradiction, combines the indestructible, the natural and
truly human, elements of the momenta which preceded it, excluding
only that in them which was the accident of time and
place and circumstance. Thus the Greek conception of life was
posed; the Christian conception was counterposed; the synthesis,
crudely attempted in the age of the Renaissance, awaits mature
accomplishment in the immediate future. The very ground-thought
of science is to treat man as part of the natural order&mdash;not,
assuredly, on that account excluding from its calculation the
most eminent portion of man, his reason and his moral being&mdash;and
to return from the study of nature with profit to the study
of man. It does not annihilate or neutralize what man has gained
from Christianity; on the contrary, the new points of morality
developed by the Christian discipline are of necessity accepted as
data by the scientific mind. Our object is to combine both the
Hellenic and the Christian conceptions in a third, which shall be
more solid and more rational than any previous manifestation of
either, superior to the Hellenic as it is no longer a mere intuition,
superior to the ecclesiastical inasmuch as it relies on no mythology,
but seeks to ascertain the law.</p>

<p>The positive knowledge about the world possessed at any period
by the human race cannot fail to modify both theology and
metaphysic. Theology, while philosophizing the immediate data
of faith, professes to embrace and account for all known facts in
a comprehensive system, which includes the hypotheses of revelation;
while popular religion rests upon opinions and figurative
conceptions formed concerning the first cause of the phenomena
observed around us and within us. The systems of theology and
the opinions of popular religion must, therefore, from time to
time in the world's history, vary according as more or less is actually
known, and according as the mind has greater or lesser power
of analyzing and co-ordinating its stores of knowledge. Metaphysic
is the critical examination and construction into a connected
scheme of the results obtained by experience&mdash;mental,
moral, and physical&mdash;subjected to reflection, and regarded in their
most abstract form as thoughts. It follows of necessity that any
revolution in the method of observation and analysis, like that
which has been going on during the last three centuries, whereby
our conception of the world as a whole is altered, must supply
metaphysic with new subject-matter and new methods, and force
it to the reconsideration of important problems. Meanwhile, the
faculty of thought itself undergoes no essential transformation;
our mental and moral nature remains substantially the same.
What has always happened, and what alone can happen, is that
fresh pabulum is offered to the thinking being, which has to be
assimilated to its organism and digested for its nourishment.
Consequently we cannot expect to have a sudden and illuminating
revolution in psychology and ethics. But, while we learn
fresh facts about the universe, our notions concerning the nature
of the first cause and the relation of man to his environments,
whether expressed in systems by theology and philosophy, or in
opinions by popular religion, must of necessity be exposed to alteration.
To adjust ourselves to this change without sacrificing
what is vitally important in religion as the basis of morality is
our difficulty.</p>

<p>Physical science, to begin with, has destroyed that old conception
of the universe which made this globe central and of paramount
importance. The discoveries of Galileo and Newton first
led to a right theory of the planetary movements. The chemists
of the last hundred years have substituted an accurate analysis of
primitive substances for rough guesses at the four elements. The
establishment of the law of the conservation of force has demonstrated
the unity of all cosmical operations from the most gigantic
to the most minute. Geology, together with the speculations
of comparative anatomists and naturalists, has altered all our notions
with regard to the age of the world, and to the antecedents
and early history of the human race. The results gathered during
the last three centuries in these and other fields of investigation
render it certain that mankind has occupied but a brief moment
in the long life of our globe, and tend to prove that our duration
here will, at an enormously but not incalculably distant period,
be rendered impossible by the action of those very forces which
called us into being. The years of humanity are therefore "a
scape in oblivion." Man, for whom, according to the author of
Genesis, the sun and moon and stars were made, is shown to be
among the less important products of the cosmical system. We
are no permanent owners, but the brief tenants of our tiny globe.
Nor need this terrify or startle us. Each man expects the certainty
of his own dissolution. The race must learn that it also is
ephemeral. For this our religions have already prepared us. But
what is new in the prospect revealed by science is that, not by a
sudden tempest of vindictive fire from heaven, but in the tranquil
course of the long life of nature, such euthanasia is prepared for
men. As the universe subsisted countless &aelig;ons before our birth,
so will it survive our loss, and scarcely keep a trace of our existence.</p>

<p>At the same time the spiritual conditions of humanity remain
unaltered. Men we are; men we must be: to find out what is
truly human, essential to the highest type and utmost happiness
of man, is still our most absorbing interest. Nor need we abandon
that noblest of all formulas: "To fear God and to keep his
commands is the whole duty of man;" provided we are careful to
accept the word God as the name of a hitherto unapprehended
energy, the symbol of that which is the life and thought and motion
of the universe whereof we are a part, the ideal towards
which we are forever struggling on the toilsome path of spiritual
evolution, the unknown within us and without us which is the
one vital, irremovable reality. Science, which consists in the determination
of laws,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> compels us to believe that, as in the physical
world invariable sequences are observed, so also in the moral nature
of man must comprehensive rules and explanations of phenomena
be observable. It is but the refusal to apply to moral
problems the scientific method with unflinching logic which leads
certain otherwise positive thinkers to recognize "the freedom of
human volition" as an incalculable and arbitrary element, and thus
to withdraw human conduct from the sphere of exact investigation.
To know God in the physical order is to know what has
been, and what is, and what will be in the economy of primeval
forces. To know God in the moral order is to know what has
been, and what is, and what will be within the region of the human
consciousness. To obey God in the physical order is to control
those forces for our own use as far as our constitution will
permit; for thus we energize in harmony with the universe. To
obey God in the moral order is to act in accordance with those
hitherto discovered laws which have carried the race onward from
barbarism to self-knowledge and self-control, and with all our
might and main to strive for further precision in their determination.
But even here is the debatable ground; here is the point
at issue; here confessedly is the region that has never yet been
subjected to science.</p>

<p>The analogy of scientific discovery forces us to look no longer
for the actual fiats of a divine voice on Sinai, but to expect that
by interrogating humanity itself we shall ultimately demonstrate
those unchangeable decrees by conforming to which our race may
pass from strength to strength. We must cease to be clairvoyants
and become analysts, verifying our intuitions by positive investigation.
For the old term Commandment, which implies the will
of a sovereign, our present condition of knowledge leads us to
substitute the new term Law as defined above.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> This, although
the subject-matter and even the practical result remain unchanged,
is no slight alteration. It implies a new motion, both popular
and scientific, of the divine in nature, a new criterion of what is
right and wrong, and in the last resort a new metaphysic.</p>

<p>But with a view to this end we have to introduce a more stringent
and painstaking method into ethics. We must be content
to abandon dogmatism upon insoluble questions, however fascinating
and imperious; we must above all things quit delusions, however
sanctioned by ancient reverence. And here both faith and
courage are needed. To believe that the moral laws are within
us, requiring to be disentangled, without the aid of an authentic
revelation, from the mass of phenomena, in the same way as physical
laws have been abstracted from facts by scientific reasoning,
demands a virile and firm confidence in the order of the universe
and in the intellectual faculty of man.</p>

<p>Hitherto in ethics we have proceeded on the <i>a priori</i> road; we
have assumed certain hypotheses, or supposed fixed starting-points,
concerning the origin and the destiny of mankind, about both of
which things we know absolutely nothing for sure. Starting with
a theological system, which accounted for the creation of man and
the nature of evil in close connection with a definite but delusive
cosmogony, taking a future state of happiness or misery for granted,
we have brought our dreams to bear upon the springs of conduct.
It is precisely at this point that science, partly by the revolution
effected in cosmical theory, partly by the exhibition of the
true method of analysis, helps to free us from what is fanciful,
and to indicate the right way for the future. It has proved in
one realm of knowledge that an advance towards truth must not
be expected from systems professing to set forth the causes of
phenomena, but from a gradual and patient exploration of the
phenomena themselves. Not matter, but the qualities of what we
call matter as subject to our senses are the object of physical science.
Not God, but human conduct, must be the object of moral
science, albeit the ideal that guides human conduct will continue
to be worshipped as our God. Nor will it here avail to demur
that the human will is essentially free, and therefore not subject
to law in the strictly scientific sense. Each step we make in the
investigation of heredity, and all the other conditions to which
man is subject, forces us more and more plainly to the conclusion
that the very seat of our supposed liberty, our desires and personal
peculiarities, distinctive tastes and special predilections, are
determined for us in great measure by circumstances beyond our
own control. The force of these circumstances, separately and in
combination, could be estimated if we possessed but the complete
data for forming such a calculation; nor does this certainty destroy
the fact that each new personality introduces a new element
into the sequence. It narrows the field wherein volition can move
freely, but leaves the soul still self-determining and capable of
being shaped. What is really incalculable is not the sphere of
action for the individual, but the source of energy in the universe,
in vital connection with which we live both physically and mentally.
We are what we are, each of us, by no freak of chance, by
no act of arbitrary spontaneity; and our prayers must take the
form dictated by Cleanthes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lead thou me, God, Law, Reason, Motion, Life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All names alike for thee are vain and hollow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead me; for I will follow without strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if I strive, still must I blindly follow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For many centuries physical science itself suffered from the dead
weight of abstract notions accepted as data, and was inert for
want of a true method. Its recent successes are an index to the
advance which moral science might make if it could adopt the
right way of investigation, comparison, and reflective reasoning.
At the same time it must be confessed that for moral science this
method has not as yet been made either easy of application or
fruitful of results. Our subject-matter is so complex and so apparently
distinct from sensible existence as to seem intangible.
Both thought and language are the heritage of countless generations,
wherein a medley of guesses and confused conceptions are
stored. Of general laws in ethics we have as yet but instinctive,
and as it were &aelig;sthetic, perceptions, fortified and enforced by theological
beliefs, or converted into intellectual notions by philosophy.
Still, this need not disturb us, when we reflect how long
it was before the true method of scientific discovery in the analysis
of matter was brought to light, and what a continuous progress
from one determination to another followed upon the single law
established in explanation of terrestrial gravity. The scientific
solution of one ethical problem, whether that be ultimately effected
through physiology by the establishment of correspondences
between the physical and moral functions of humanity, or through
comparative history and the study of evolution, may prove as
fruitful for ethics as the discovery of Galileo was for physics. It
is impossible to utter dogmatic predictions at this point of our
knowledge. Yet we may indulge in hopes that are of the nature
of dreams. Can we not in this way venture to anticipate that the
men of the future may obtain demonstrated certainty with regard
to man considered as an integral portion of the universe; that
they may understand the conditions of his conduct as clearly as
we now apprehend the behavior of certain gases; and that their
problem will be, not how to check healthy normal appetites, but
how to multiply and fortify faculties? Can we not dream that
morality will be one branch of the study of the world as a whole,
a department of &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8049;, when &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;, regarded as a total unity,
that suffers no crude radical distinction of mind and body, has absorbed
our scientific attention?</p>

<p>We need not fear that either the new notion of Deity forced
upon us by the extension of our knowledge, even should this destroy
the last vestige of anthropomorphism, or the involved application
of a positive method to ethics, will lead to what is dreaded
as materialism. If materialism be not a mere name, it is feared
because it is thought to imply egotism, immersion in sensuality,
and indifference to ideas. But what is the prospect unrolled before
us by science?<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> What is, in effect, the new intellectual atmosphere
to which we must acclimatize our moral and religious
sensibilities? Surely the most sublime, the most ideally imaginative,
which it has ever been given to man to contemplate. The
spectacle of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, alike of
the mental and the physical, the natural and the supersensible,
subordinated to unchangeable laws, and permeated by one single
energy, revealed to us by science, contains nothing that need drive
us to a stolid atheism, but rather such considerations as give the
value of positive certainty to Christ's words about the sparrow.
We <i>know</i> now that the whole past history of the universe is involved
in the blood-beats of the smallest animalcule discernible by
the microscope, that the farthest fixed star to which our telescopes
have any access obeys the laws that determine the action of our
muscles, that our thought holds in solution the experience of all
preceding ages. If the religion of the future is to be founded on
scientific bases of this nature, there is surely less room for the extravagances
of egoism and sensuality than there was in the Catholic
system from which emerged a Sixtus IV. and an Alexander
VI. What St. Paul conceived but dimly, the physicist declares to
us: we are all parts and members of the divine whole. It is the
business of science not to make God nowhere in the universe, but
everywhere, and to prove, what previous moralists have guessed,
that the happiness and the freedom of man consist in his self-subordination
to the laws of the world, whereof he is an essential,
though an insignificant, part. Against the decrees of God, conceived
as a sovereign subject to like fluctuations of emotion with
ourselves, it was possible to offend again and again without losing
the hope that at some facile moment, some <i>mollia tempora fandi</i>,
he might be propitiated. The laws of the world are inexorable;
they alone enforce with absolute equity the maxim &#964;&#8183; &#948;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;
&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;.</p>

<p>Instead of materialism, it might be more reasonable, perhaps, to
dread fatalism; but fatalism is a rock on which all systems, philosophical
and religious, when carried to abstract conclusions, have
tended to drift. Science cannot be more fatalistic than Calvinism;
yet the instinctive belief in the liberty of the individual has survived
all logic, and is likely still to do so till such time as the
prevailing intuition shall be positively proved. And even were
the conviction that we are not free agents in the old sense of the
phrase to be forced upon us, the sting of fatalism would be extracted
together with the belief in an omnipotent personality,
framing men of set purpose for honor and dishonor. It was the
clash of the human and the divine wills, both equally finite, though
the latter was isolated by abstraction and ticketed with the epithet
of infinity&mdash;in other words, the fiction of a despot ruling over
slaves&mdash;that gave its terror to necessity.</p>

<p>Before the latest discoveries of physical science, as before the
highest philosophical analysis, the cruder distinctions of soul and
body, spirit and matter, tend to disappear. The nature of the
universe is proved too subtle for this dichotomy. Only a coarse
intelligence will, therefore, run to the conclusion that so-called
matter, with its supposed finality, is absolute; or that so-called
thought, with its supposed infinity, is universal. The finer intelligence,
convinced of the correlation between these apparently antagonistic
moments, must pause to contemplate the everlasting sequences
of time past extended into time to come, and in the end
must feel persuaded of its own indissoluble connection with that,
whatever it may be, which is permanent in the universe. The
moment Now is a potential eternity. That we are is a sufficient
proof that we have been and that we shall be. Each act, as it
has had immeasurable and necessary antecedents, will be fruitful
of immeasurable and necessary consequents; for the web of the
world is ever weaving, and to drop a thread in it is utterly impossible.
That we are such or such is, again, the proof that our
qualities have in them something significant, both for that which
has been, and for that which will be for everlasting. We have
been, we are, we shall be, a part of the eternal complex. Not,
therefore, are we at liberty to assume definite propositions concerning
what is called the immortality of the soul. To do so in
the present state of knowledge would be as much a begging of
the question as to dogmatize upon the so-called personality of
God. Suspension of judgment is as imperatively required of us
by science as faith in the unintelligible was demanded by the
Catholic Church. As then trial of the faith wrought patience, so
now wise abstinence from dogmatism is the attitude of faith.</p>

<p>Following this course of thought into particulars, we have no
reason to apprehend that personal license should result from a system
of purely positive ethics based upon that conception of our
relation to the universe which science is revealing. On the contrary,
we may expect from the establishment of such a system a
code of conduct more stringent in all that can concern the well-being
of the individual than any that has yet been conceived. In
the future, sensual excess will surely be reckoned a form of madness,
and what we now dignify by the name of vice will be relegated,
shorn of Satanic lustre, to the lazar-house. Nor need we
fear that purely mental problems should lose their value or become
less interesting. No amount of demonstration that the
mind is dependent on the brain can so confuse the reason of a
lucid thinker as to make him conclude that, therefore, there is no
mind. Reduce all our emotions, our habits, our thoughts, to
modes of cell-existence&mdash;prove that thinking and feeling are functions
of nerve-centres&mdash;the mystery has only shifted its centre of
gravity; we are still ourselves for better or for worse; thought
and feeling are still the essential part of us; man remains, in spite
of all, the only known being to whom the command &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8056;&#957;
has been given, together with the faculty of obeying this command.
Physical Science does not exclude her elder sisters Philosophy
and Religion, though she may compel religion to abandon
mythology, and supply philosophy with new worlds for analysis.
What she does is to substitute solid, if slowly discovered, knowledge
for guesses, and a patient but progressive method for the
systems which ontologist after ontologist has built and pulled to
pieces. Will not the men of the future look back with wonder
on the ages in which religion, philosophy, and the science of nature
were supposed to be at war, instead of being, as they will be
then, one system?</p>
